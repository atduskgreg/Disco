I  looked and some of your funds haven't done so well this year especially Low  Priced Stock.  Also, I am worried about earnings for many companies with  energy prices so high and the prospect of very high prices this winter.  I  don't know but it might be prudent to even move some money into cash or up  your bond exposure.  I'll try to call you and talk about it later.

The data includes max temp, max temp deviation from normal (ie if max is 88  and normal max is 86 max temp deviation is +2), min temp, min temp deviation  from normal and percent of precipitation.  So far things are looking good.   We are getting a cold front this weekend (hitting Texas on Monday) and looks  like things should be beautiful for next weekend.  I wouldn't be that worried  about the rain either - the reason the POP is so high right now is tropical  moisture in the Gulf of Mexico and that will blow through this weekend.   After that the tropics settle down and it is much less likely to get  tropical  moisture.

Actually we had already planned on Amy  and Alec coming and a couple who we are friends with is bringing their  daughter, our flower girl, who is about 4 years old.  We have a whole room to  ourselves at the restaurant so Amy and Alec should be fine.  I talked to  grandma and she said Julie wouldn't be able to make it so I already knew  about that.  Don't worry about having 4 more people, the only reason we were  cautious about inviting aunts and uncles was we didn't want to open up the  flood gates but most of them already live in Houston or aren't going to make  it to Houston until late Friday.  As far as the bill just let me know what  you are comfortable with and we will pick up the rest.  The food bill with  tax and tip will be about $1,350.  We are very appreciative to have both our  parent's help as we quickly found that weddings are very expensive.  However,  we are both adults with good careers and try to be very self-sufficient.   Also, we realize that some things we do seem extravagant by our parents  standards.  We could have just as easily had a rehearsal at a Mexican  restaurant and it would have been cheaper - however we would rather have  things a certain way and pay for the difference.  Also, I know that you guys  are on a tight budget with the building of your house.  The bottom line is  that we are grateful for any help we receive and have the resources to pay  the balance.  Our most  important concern is that all our family and friends  to have a great time.  While I am on the subject, I hope your mother and  grandma Ina aren't going to get their feeling hurt about people drinking wine  at the dinner.  If you think they will please mention it to them on the way  down because I don't want them to be offended but I can't change who Zooey  and I are.  Just so you know we will have dinner and desert and then there  will be several toasts starting with the best man (James Cook) and the matron  of honor (Amber) and then probably ending in Zooey and me doing a quick  toast.  We would love for all our family to be there but if grandmother or  Betty Joyce is going to get offended and don't want to stay I understand.   Also, do you know if Skipper is planning to attend.  We haven't received a  reply card as to whether he will be there or not.  As to this weekend, I am  going to try to stop by but don't have a car so just depends what is going  on.  I will be in Dallas so if Mark is coming over Saturday afternoon I could  get a ride from him.  I'll try to talk to him and see if that works.   Finally, we are both really looking forward to our big day and are very glad  to have all our family there to support us!  If you have any questions please  call me tonight at the house. Sharon.Cuilla@nlrb.gov on 09/19/2000 12:57:00 PM To: martin.cuilla@enron.com cc:   Subject: Plans      Hi Marty,      Amy and I were talking over the weekend and she said she did not plan      to attend the rehearsal dinner because there was no one to keep Alec.      Would you and Zooey think it was OK if she came and brought Alec for      dinner only and left as soon as they were through eating?  She said      she did not want to ask you about it because she didn't want you or      Zooey to feel any pressure.  This is your special time and she doesn't      want to detract from it in any way.  I feel sorry for her missing out.      It is hard for Alec to be still and quite for very long but I think he      would be fine while we are eating.  Would you please talk with Zooey      and ask her how she feels about Amy bringing Alec for a while.  Amy      would leave right away if Alec was disturbing anyone.  If you prefer      he doesn't come, just say so.  There will certainly be no hard      feelings over it.      I spoke with Betty Joyce Sunday and Julianna and her husband are not      going to be able to come.  Joyce, Chester, Renee, and Travis (her      boyfriend) are planning to arrive in Houston Friday afternoon the      29th.  Dad and I are bringing Grandma Ina and Mamanet with us and      should arrive early in the afternoon on Friday.  Mike decided to fly      and is coming in Saturday around 4 p.m.  There will be 9 or 11      (depending if Amy comes) of us from our family for the rehearsal      dinner.  I know that is more that you had planned on but I will pay      for the extra people.  Why don't you call me when you have time and we      can talk about it.      Now that Mamanet is coming, she is very excited about the trip.  She      called me yesterday when she got her ticket and she said she had      really wanted to come but didn't think she would have the chance to      come.  I'm glad I was able to work it out.      Grandma Ina will arrive here this week on Thursday.  It seems like I      remember you and Zooey were going to be in town this weekend for her      class reunion.  I know you have a busy schedule and may not have time      to come by, but if you do let me know when and we will plan lunch or      whatever.  If you have time you can see the new house.  It is looking      better every day.      Love,      Mom subject: Re: Plans "

The data includes max temp, max temp deviation from normal (ie if max is 88  and normal max is 86 max temp deviation is +2), min temp, min temp deviation  from normal and percent of precipitation.  So far things are looking good.   We are getting a cold front this weekend (hitting Texas on Monday) and looks  like things should be beautiful for next weekend.  I wouldn't be that worried  about the rain either - the reason the POP is so high right now is tropical  moisture in the Gulf of Mexico and that will blow through this weekend.   After that the tropics settle down and it is much less likely to get  tropical  moisture.

martin.cuilla@enron.com,0,0,0.324,c25e67b3-b36a-421a-958b-3809ccb12dae,"body: Amy and Alec are definitely welcome!  Actually we had already planned on Amy  and Alec coming and a couple who we are friends with is bringing their  daughter, our flower girl, who is about 4 years old.  We have a whole room to  ourselves at the restaurant so Amy and Alec should be fine.  I talked to  grandma and she said Julie wouldn't be able to make it so I already knew  about that.  Don't worry about having 4 more people, the only reason we were  cautious about inviting aunts and uncles was we didn't want to open up the  flood gates but most of them already live in Houston or aren't going to make  it to Houston until late Friday.  As far as the bill just let me know what  you are comfortable with and we will pick up the rest.  The food bill with  tax and tip will be about $1,350.  We are very appreciative to have both our  parent's help as we quickly found that weddings are very expensive.  However,  we are both adults with good careers and try to be very self-sufficient.   Also, we realize that some things we do seem extravagant by our parents  standards.  We could have just as easily had a rehearsal at a Mexican  restaurant and it would have been cheaper - however we would rather have  things a certain way and pay for the difference.  Also, I know that you guys  are on a tight budget with the building of your house.  The bottom line is  that we are grateful for any help we receive and have the resources to pay  the balance.  Our most  important concern is that all our family and friends  to have a great time.  While I am on the subject, I hope your mother and  grandma Ina aren't going to get their feeling hurt about people drinking wine  at the dinner.  If you think they will please mention it to them on the way  down because I don't want them to be offended but I can't change who Zooey  and I are.  Just so you know we will have dinner and desert and then there  will be several toasts starting with the best man (James Cook) and the matron  of honor (Amber) and then probably ending in Zooey and me doing a quick  toast.  We would love for all our family to be there but if grandmother or  Betty Joyce is going to get offended and don't want to stay I understand.   Also, do you know if Skipper is planning to attend.  We haven't received a  reply card as to whether he will be there or not.  As to this weekend, I am  going to try to stop by but don't have a car so just depends what is going  on.  I will be in Dallas so if Mark is coming over Saturday afternoon I could  get a ride from him.  I'll try to talk to him and see if that works.   Finally, we are both really looking forward to our big day and are very glad  to have all our family there to support us!  If you have any questions please  call me tonight at the house. Sharon.Cuilla@nlrb.gov on 09/19/2000 12:57:00 PM To: martin.cuilla@enron.com cc:   Subject: Plans      Hi Marty,      Amy and I were talking over the weekend and she said she did not plan      to attend the rehearsal dinner because there was no one to keep Alec.      Would you and Zooey think it was OK if she came and brought Alec for      dinner only and left as soon as they were through eating?  She said      she did not want to ask you about it because she didn't want you or      Zooey to feel any pressure.  This is your special time and she doesn't      want to detract from it in any way.  I feel sorry for her missing out.      It is hard for Alec to be still and quite for very long but I think he      would be fine while we are eating.  Would you please talk with Zooey      and ask her how she feels about Amy bringing Alec for a while.  Amy      would leave right away if Alec was disturbing anyone.  If you prefer      he doesn't come, just say so.  There will certainly be no hard      feelings over it.      I spoke with Betty Joyce Sunday and Julianna and her husband are not      going to be able to come.  Joyce, Chester, Renee, and Travis (her      boyfriend) are planning to arrive in Houston Friday afternoon the      29th.  Dad and I are bringing Grandma Ina and Mamanet with us and      should arrive early in the afternoon on Friday.  Mike decided to fly      and is coming in Saturday around 4 p.m.  There will be 9 or 11      (depending if Amy comes) of us from our family for the rehearsal      dinner.  I know that is more that you had planned on but I will pay      for the extra people.  Why don't you call me when you have time and we      can talk about it.      Now that Mamanet is coming, she is very excited about the trip.  She      called me yesterday when she got her ticket and she said she had      really wanted to come but didn't think she would have the chance to      come.  I'm glad I was able to work it out.      Grandma Ina will arrive here this week on Thursday.  It seems like I      remember you and Zooey were going to be in town this weekend for her      class reunion.  I know you have a busy schedule and may not have time      to come by, but if you do let me know when and we will plan lunch or      whatever.  If you have time you can see the new house.  It is looking      better every day.      Love,      Mom subject: Re: Plans "

webmaster@cera.com,0,0,0.447,ce563f5b-4aea-4896-8623-621f68cedcb9,"body: CERA Alert: Dcember 13, 2000  Title: California on the Brink  CERA Knowledge Areas: Western Energy, N. American Power, N. American Gas  CALIFORNIA ON THE BRINK  The California Stalemate  California moved closer to the brink of an outage today as concerns over  credit-worthiness of buyers brought the possibility that generators would  avoid selling to the California market. While numerous factors have  contributed to the high cost of power incurred by California's utilities, the  root cause of the current crisis is a lack of new generation. The current  credit crisis and its threat to supplies could spark state action to address  the situation. The collective efforts of all market participants should be  focused on increasing generation capacity as quickly as possible. Western power prices have skyrocketed well beyond the record levels set this  summer. Perhaps because frozen rates insulate the majority of California  consumers and companies from tangible effects of the market crisis,  regulators have been able to postpone meaningful market reforms and  significant rate increases. The California Public Utilities Commission denied  the requests of Pacific Gas & Electric and Southern California Edison to end  their rate freezes, forcing these utilities at least temporarily to finance  the costs of higher wholesale energy. This has created an unsustainable  accumulation of costs and a loss of faith in the California market.  The current credit crisis and the potential for blackouts may become the  galvanizing events that provide state regulators with a public mandate to  address the underlying structural problems in the industry. However, there is  no guarantee that these regulatory actions will expedite an effective  solution for customers and the industry as a whole. Wholesale and retail  markets that emerge from regulatory intervention are likely to remain  muddled. In the necessarily political process that will follow, it is  possible that-as has largely been the case so far-the steps taken will fail  to move the California power market toward a more enduring solution and will  instead continue to mask the underlying structural flaws.  In the six months since California's supply shortfall began plaguing Western  markets, regulators have done little to address the underlying problem.  Rather than addressing the cause of the supply shortage-establishing a market  environment that encourages timely additions of new generating capacity and  demand side responses-efforts are instead directed at trying to lay blame for  the crisis and lessen the immediate financial impact on customers. Indeed,  several actions taken thus far have served more to compound the problem by  discouraging new power plant additions. These include price caps, repeated  changes to market rules, attempts to seize generator profits, and a  challenging siting and permitting process. Medicine Worse than the Illness  Several years of electricity demand growth and low prices in California were  accompanied by very few additions to the supply base. Regulators did not pay  adequate attention to the looming supply shortfall. The void of consensus  over the cause of the current crisis has instead been replaced by a series of  bandaid remedies that address the symptoms, but not the cause, of  California's electric market woes.*  * Challenging siting and permitting. Despite state action to better  coordinate the siting and permitting process for new power plants, power  plant developers still face high hurdles. Local community opposition alone  has struck down some key proposed facilities. * Price caps discourage investment. State and federal proposals to cap prices  limit the attractiveness of the California wholesale power market, especially  for developers who have the option of channeling scarce capital and equipment  to more stable or more attractive markets outside the state.  * Repeated rule changes. Frequent rule changes in the ISO markets (including  the price caps) confound attempts by developers to estimate profits from new  plant development. * Calls for refunds. Despite reports by the Power Exchange, the ISO, and the  FERC that no pattern of abuse could be found from their examination of the  California markets, state officials continue to accuse power providers of  gaming the market. Calls by state officials for refunds of generator profits  are a threat to new plant development. * Facility inspections. Recent inspections of power plants by state officials  to verify that operators are honestly reporting the operational status of  their generating units accentuates the atmosphere of mistrust. CERA's recent analysis suggests that merchant plant developers in the West  are not guaranteed? to make a profit. Prospects of new plant profitability  are affected by the timing and quantity of new plants, decommissioning of  older units, demand growth, and numerous other difficult-to-forecast factors.  California's regulatory actions only further cloud the assessment of  financial viability and degrade the political environment for developers  considering entering the state.  Despite efforts by the California ISO to stimulate new capacity additions in  the state with a special, limited-term capacity payment, CERA estimates that  demand growth will continue to outstrip supply additions in the West in 2001.  In addition, the existing siting and permitting process will prevent a  sufficient quantity of capacity from entering the market until 2003 at the  earliest. Therefore, three years remain before a sufficient quantity of  capacity enters service to significantly dampen prices and decrease the risk  of an outage.  The Road to Recovery  There are a number of actions that can be taken to help relieve the capacity  shortfall:  * Encourage new build. Supply must be part of the answer. This requires a  series of steps that can help facilitate new supply build. While in principal  some have been taken, such as new fast track approval, the success of these  actions can only be measured by the build itself. For now, there is still not  enough new supply coming on until 2003 to relieve supply tightness.?  * Stabilize investment climate. Utilities must have assurance that they will  ultimately be allowed to recover market costs for power. This provides the  credit worthiness needed by sellers to produce energy and to stimulate new  build. * Move toward more balanced utility supply portfolios. One of the reasons the  pressure on customers has been so intense in California has been the absence  (and even discouragement) of diverse supply portfolios among the utilities in  the state-particularly for residential and small commercial customers. With  the market at a peak, however, now is in one sense a sub-optimal time to move  toward term contracting. Yet these contracts provide the foundation for a  series of actions-including new supply build and demand side investments. If  they end up above market, they will at least have achieved the desired effect  of knocking down prices, a fact which by itself should provide sufficient  justification for recovering the cost of these commitments. * Encourage market mechanisms that elicit a demand response. Although  originally a feature of California's market design, most consumers are  insulated from price spikes through capped or frozen retail rates. Exposing  customers to at least some of the market price signals would encourage a  demand response. * Encourage market mechanisms that dampen the ""Boom Bust"" characteristic of  the market. Whether in the form of a capacity payment, a reserve requirement,  or a minimum term portfolio requirement, the California power market needs to  move to a structure that encourages investment in new capacity when the  market is in balance rather than waiting for a shortage and price shock to  elicit new investment. Such a structure can help dampen (but not eliminate)  future price volatility. * Avoid continuously tinkering with the market. While the market does need to  be restructured as described above, it also needs to be stable and reliable  to encourage the development of new supply as well as a robust long-term  contractual market for power in California. Continually tinkering with the  market structure-such as the three times the price cap has been shifted since  July-only serves to undermine confidence in the market. California needs to  do its best to develop a long-term solution and then let the market run its  course.  * Allow for greater environmental flexibility. The state should explore a  more balanced solution to emissions restrictions in the face of a supply  shortfall that has been exacerbated by generators that cannot operate due to  emissions restrictions.  * Free PURPA power plants to generate. Relief should be granted to PURPA  power plants that are operational, but are restricted by contract from  operating to generate only power.  **end**  This CERA Alert will be available in PDF format within 24 hours.  **********************************************************************  This electronic message and attachments, if any, contain information  from Cambridge Energy Research Associates, Inc.

EnTelligence training now available! Date: Tuesday, Dec 12 Time: 3:00 and 4:00 Location: EB 572 Please stop by to learn more about the system or just get a demo of what it  can do for you!!! Overview EnTelligence is a web-based prospecting tool designed to deliver market  information on existing and potential customers to commercial trading,  mid-marketing, and origination teams.  It also delivers management reports to  analyze Enron,s position within the key industries that we serve.  Presently,  commercial groups have multiple methods for acquiring potential customer  information.  This system will standardize their resource tools and add  consistency to their prospecting processes.  EnTelligence combines  information from internal databases such as Global Counterparty, Credit  Aggregation System (CAS), Sitara, and ERMS with information from external  data sources such as Dun & Bradstreet and I.H.S Energy Reporter to identify  customer prospects.  By providing the capability to filter and search by  region, industry, company size, or energy consumption levels, the prospecting  process is shortened and the identification of strong prospects improved.  Available reports include Market Penetration, Industry Prospecting,  Comparison Prospecting, Company Profiles, Family Tree, Top Customers, and  Inactive Accounts.  Soon to come is the Activity Details report in mid  January.  Currently only Natural Gas and Power physical deals are loaded, but  financial deals will be included in mid January, and new products are soon to  follow.

Basically, I started off with your proposed procedures  and made a few changes that Enron needs to make sure that right amount of gas shows up  at the correct time. Also, we are suggesting a confirmation form be sent back and forth between  Enron and Sithe every day.  This will help document all the small little details and  costs so that we both drop anything through the cracks.  I am suggesting that we e-mail this  confirm form to the right folks in both our companies, so that no one is left out of the  loop. You will also notice our attempt to make sure that everyone has a clear  understanding of exactly what is included in the numbers that are reported to Enron's  traders.  The timing of your calls will be when everyone is very busy in our trading group.  There  will not be much time to have long conversations, but it is very important that everyone have  the same understanding what the numbers mean. Please take a look at this on your side and see if there are some other  things that need to be included. Thanks, Ruth subject: Procedures for Incremental Empire Gas for On-Peak Day Ahead Market "

I image that are still under estimating next year earnings  based on where the strip of natural gas is.

zwharton@dawray.com,0,0,0.364,48837ab8-de16-4a65-9301-5b7b35a5696b,"body:  FYI - I just recently paid for a portion of our At&T bill with the rest of the free money in our Waterhouse account (wrote a check in the amount of like $2200).  The remaining balance is something like $2,500.  All of that amount is allocated to our monthly savings for property/school taxes.  I guess what you're saying is you would like to borrow from this savings account to make this investment.  As long as you feel confident that we will be able to reimburse that amount somehow to pay our taxes (should we not get a return on the investment), then I guess we should go for it if it's something you're excited about and believe is a good investment. Naturally, I would prefer we only invest $500 because of the risk involved and Christmas just around the corner, but you're the one with the financial instincts and know-how.

Hey how much of the money in our Waterhouse account is budgeted for expenses.  I am thinking that it would be a good investment (speculative in nature though) to purchase some options on Enron.  The options would expire in January and the potential return could vary between a loss of 100% of the investment to a 400%-500% return.  I think between a $500-$1,000 investment would be wise given the nature of it. MC subject: RE: ??????? "

Also, two other  things - I checked BofA and the Negril pulse came through as $142.09 and also  I was looking at the AT&T credit card and it had a charge for $117.50 from  Chi's cakes and more.

As most of you already know, it has been a crazy weekend for some of us.  I'm going to address why all this happened, what we have done, and the ongoing problems we are having? About 8 months ago Martin Cuilla took a position on a curve called GD-AECOUSD-DAIL.  On Friday he wanted to move this position to another curve called GD-AECOCD/FRWKD.  We had being seeing the position come in on the bench report but apparently VaR was not being captured on it.  It was not in the Primary/Secondary curve mapping table in Risktrac and was not mapped to an intra-month curve either (OMICRON).   On Friday evening I asked Burton to map the new curve in the primary /secondary table and Virendra to map it to OMICRON_9.  If this would have worked we expected Cuillas VaR to fall by approx. $800K given the risk structure of his positions.  But the desired results were not achieved.   On Saturday with the help of Ramesh, Virendra and Burton we tried several different combinations of mappings with no positive results.  The positions do not seem to be coming in as we are not picking up the book in Component Var.  The book should be INTRA-ONTARIO-CAD2.  It exists but, there are no positions in it.   The only reason this would happen if the curve had no Volatilities or Prices associated with it.  We need to find out why this is so?  Understand also that AECOCD/FRWKD is a derived curve so it has no Prices and Vols of it's own but takes it from AECO-CDN/IM.  We have also mapped AECO-CDN/IM to CGPR-AECO/BASIS and to OMICRON_9 but still are not getting any changes.   Ramesh, Burton Virendra, and Bruce have all worked very hard this weekend, despite having other work related commitments, to try to resolve this, and have gone over and above what was expected of them.  But despite all our efforts this is still a problem that needs addressing.   Cuilla is very concerned about this because Lavorato is watching him.  I have to answer to him tomorrow and cannot use systems issues as an excuse.  I want us as a team to look at this tomorrow and in the short-run fix Cuillas VaR.  We also want curve mapping to become a more front-end solution (with very few users) because of their (the front office) knowledge of where the different curves need to be mapped.  Kam Keiser will help us with this. In the long-run I don't want any of us to have to do this again and want to identify a solution.  Ramesh has rightly pointed out that this will take time and resources on his side.  Given the speed of the work in this place none of us have either extra time or resources but, we have to find a way and, most of all be patient while we address these issues. Please understand that tomorrow may be a little hectic for all concerned parties but to be patient while we try to reach the root of the problem.  Nilay we will need your expertise about curve mappings, and OMICRONS, for this?   Thanks again for all your help this weekend....... Regards Bharat subject: FW: Weekend Events......... "

This October, 25th, the global domination of this heavily demanded DJ Stops in Houston at Hyperia! Seb has dance music in his blood from the day he was conceived in Ibiza - his mother is a semi-professional DJ. Growing up in West London, Seb?s initial musical development was stimulated by ska, but soon dropped out of sixth form college to pursue a career as a DJ. His first ?proper? gig was at Crazy Larry?s on the Kings Road, getting paid ?30 a night to spin tunes for a typical Eighties ?sloanie? crew. By 1989, Seb landed a residency at The Fridge, Brixton, where he played mainly hip hop and rare groove, swiftly followed a year later by a residency at The Wag, playing ragga, rare groove and acid. Next came a residency at Subterania, alongside Norman Jay and Jeremy Healy. In 1993, Seb gained his first house residency at Glitterati at The Cross. Malibu Stacey was the next stop for Seb - a night he put together and promoted at the Hanover Grand with friend Craig Richards. As Malibu got more established, Seb got increasingly restless, and took to the road in a big way, focusing more and more outside of London, becoming one of the UK?s hardest working ?motorway jocks?. At the same time, music becomes harder and deeper. In 1998, Seb was offerred a fortnightly residency at Cream, which soon became a weekly gig. In 1999, Seb took Ibiza by storm, with Cream at Amnesia. Seb Fontaine clinched the deal with Radio 1 in February 2000, initially to deputise for dance shows exclusively on Radio 1, gaining him the nickname ?super-sub?. He also joins Radio 1 in its mammoth summer of live music at the major dance festivals, and at the station?s own Radio 1 Dance Parties.  _______________________________________________________________________ Powered by List Builder To unsubscribe follow the link: http://lb.bcentral.com/ex/manage/subscriberprefs?customerid=6913&subid=67D71C0DBF29CD64&msgnum=65 subject: THURSDAY NIGHT ITS SEB FOUNTAINE @ HYPERIA "

The topsy turvy season may be good for Neilson Ratings but not so good for your blood pressure.   Sometimes, the best thing to do is laugh a little.   With that said, I'm forwarding a column I found entertaining from one of our favorite Sportswriters, Bill Simmons of ESPN.com I do this every so often.   And I always get a bunch of email yelling about ""I didn't sign up for this"" and to ""keep it serious and on Football"".   Save your breath.   Unsubscribe instructions are at the bottom of this email. Let's jump to Mr. Simmons.   You can find the original article here http://espn.go.com/page2/s/simmons/011023.html Lighten Up, Joe /**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/ Whazzup with the NFL? By Bill Simmons, ESPN.com With apologies to CNNSI's Peter King, here are 10 things I think I think after six weeks of the NFL season: 1. I think this has been the strangest NFL season in recent memory. The media usually starts their ""This has been the strangest season ever!"" buzz around Week 5 or Week 6 -- it's an NFL October Tradition, right up there with my girlfriend asking on Sunday at noon if I want to go apple-picking, me following that question up with the answer, ""What are you, insane?"" and her storming out of the house -- but this season really has been the strangest season of all-time. Consider the following things: Twenty of the 31 NFL teams have records of .500 or better. The short list of quality teams this season includes Chicago, San Diego and San Francisco (combined record last season: 12-36). Out of the nine consensus Super Bowl ""contenders"" from the preseason, only three of them (Green Bay, St. Louis and Philadelphia) have winning records. The other six (Indy, Tampa, Baltimore, Tennessee, Denver and the Giants) are a combined 15-18. After the favorites went 35-21 against the spread in the first four weeks, the underdogs went 22-4-2 over the next two weeks. (22-4-2! That's impossible!) The Patriots are slightly above-average as a football team, maybe even a little better when you factor in their coaching staff and team chemistry ... and there isn't an NFL team they couldn't beat if they played well and get two or three breaks. No 2001 victory is out of their grasp. Seriously. And just for the record, I feel the same way about the Browns and Falcons. Along those same lines, other than St. Louis, there isn't a reliable favorite in the league anymore. Remember the days when you could count on a contender to bounce back from an embarrassing defeat the following week? (What happened to Denver and Baltimore last week? Didn't they get the memo?) Remember the days when you could throw two quality home teams into a two-team tease and assume they would cover at home (like Tampa, New Orleans and Indianapolis, for instance)? Remember the days when the home team was money on Monday nights (like this week with the Giants)? I miss those days. And so does my wallet. So what's left? I'm not sure. We already achieved Pete Rozelle's vision of a parity-driven NFL two seasons ago, when the 200-to-1 underdog Rams cruised to a Super Bowl title. Now we've reached a point where the league has become predictably unpredictable. It's a gambler's worst nightmare. (Which reminds me...) 2. I think the local weatherman in hell will report ""Temperatures in the midteens all weekend"" before I wager on a team that prominently features Jon Kitna again. 2a. I think that there's excruciating, there's really excruciating ... and then there's the experience of watching Carolina's Chris Weinke throwing two interceptions inside the 10-yard-line in the first half against a brutal Redskins team, then singlehandedly giving the 'Skins life with 10 minutes remaining in a 14-0 game (by tossing a screen pass right to LaVar Arrington for a 67-yard interception and touchdown). Can everyone who wagered on the Panthers last Sunday file a class-action suit against Weinke? Has this ever been done before? 2b. I think the lesson here, as always, is ""Never wager on a team with a crappy QB."" And I knew this! I knew this. Normally I'd fine myself, but the financial bloodbath has already been devastating enough. Does anyone know a good pawn shop in the Boston area? (Whoops... I'm using my out-loud voice again...) 2c. I think I miss the days when you could recoup your 1 p.m. gambling losses by wagering on two sturdy 4 p.m. teams in ""Message Game"" situations. For instance, Sunday featured Denver coming off an embarrassing loss in Seattle (and heading into San Diego for an AFC West tilt), as well as the Packers looking to drive a stake in Minnesota's season and extend their lead in the NFC Central. In the old days, you could rely on the Mike Shanahans and Brett Favres of the world to save your butt. Not anymore. As I told my buddy J-Bug last night, ""This has become a league which I am unfamiliar with."" All of the gambling rules accrued over the years ... you might as well throw them out the window. I give up. 3. I think I always get excited for those Coors Light commercials with Barry Sanders for one reason: Sanders possesses the strangest hairline of anyone on the planet. And just for the record, that includes Shane Battier, Roy Firestone, Elton John and Brad Daugherty. (Note: Somebody needs to release the Barry Sanders Wig for Halloween this month, along with the Dave Campo Wig, the Troy Aikman Concussion Mask, the Dave Wannstedt Fake Mustache, the Al Groh Blow-Up Doll and the Fred Taylor ""Pull Your Own Groin"" Start-Up Kit. I'm telling you, NFL Collectibles should have a whole Halloween Department. It's a no-brainer. They could even release an ""NFL Legends,"" collection so we could finally get our hands on the Bruce Coslet Wig. Can somebody make this happen, please?) 4. I think it took 16 frustrating years, but Doug Flutie finally found the right NFL team. It's funny how life works out -- had the Bills decided to keep him over Rob Johnson, Flutie would have spent his twilight years on a rebuilding team. Instead, he's the proverbial ""Right Guy, Right Place, Right Time,"" on a team where he doesn't have to carry the offensive load -- unless it's absolutely necessary (like Sunday, when Denver stacked the line against the sublime LaDainian Tomlinson, putting the game in Flutie's hands). 4a. I think Tampa Bay made an enormous mistake going for Brad Johnson over Flutie ... and I think it probably costs Tony Dungy his job within the next one to four months. 4b. I think it's fair to say that the list of ""Reliable Quarterbacks Who Can Consistently Win Games"" has been whittled down to four: Brett Favre, Kurt Warner, Jeff Garcia and Flutie. That's it. That's the list. Think about it. Daunte Culpepper and Donovan McNabb make too many mistakes. Brian Griese, Rich Gannon and Mark Brunell are only as good as the people around them. Peyton Manning is slapping together a Karl Malone-type career (and his Ewing Theory potential is jumping off the charts). Steve McNair and Chris Chandler can't stay healthy. Drew Bledsoe has been hideously exposed by Tom Brady (more on this in a second). Look at the list again: Favre, Warner, Flutie and Garcia. Three of those four guys were forced to prove themselves in other professional leagues before another NFL team even gave them a chance. (I ask you again ... is this a weird NFL season or what?) 5. I think we've reached the section of the ""10 Things"" column where I'm supposed to talk about non-sports items, like high school field hockey and Starbucks. (Racking my brain ...) (All right ...) I'm ashamed to admit this, but Monday night I went to see the new Drew Barrymore movie ""Riding in Cars with Boys,"" accompanying the Sports Gal as p art of our ""She won't bitch about the fact that I spend seven hours every Sunday watching football if I escort her to an occasional chick flick and don't bitch about it"" deal. Savvy, huh? I only have two hopes with chick flicks: that they're short and that there's a cute actress prominently involved. Needless to say, since ""Riding in Cars"" lasted for 140 interminable minutes and the wheels came off the ""Drew Barrymore is a babe"" bandwagon about three years ago, I spent the last 45 minutes trying to pull a piece of metal off the bottom of my seat so I could jam it into my jugular vein. Even the Sports Gal didn't like the movie that much, and this is coming from a person who was peeved that the Academy Award committee snubbed ""The Wedding Planner"" last spring. Five disturbing phenomenons about the chick flick: Every chick flick has a scene where either A) a male baby pees on somebody, B) there's a wedding, and/or C) there's an unredeeming male character who lets somebody down. This is apparently a rule. If you can work all three of those scenes in the same movie, the director apparently gets a $50,000 bonus. Whenever I see a chick flick, there's always a moment when I accidentally make eye contact with another boyfriend or spouse at the theater and we quickly glance away. It's like seeing somebody in the adult section of a video store -- you're just hoping nobody will recognize you and things will move along as quickly as possible. I'll sum up the storyline from every chick flick: ""Men suck."" There's always a specific threesome sitting somewhere in the theater during every chick flick -- one girl sitting between two guys. Why two? I have no idea. Usually, they seem like platonic friends, the girl isn't very attractive, at least one of the guys looks like Tim Burton, and the guys overlaugh at every joke in the movie, to the point that you start rooting for one of them to choke to death on a Sour Patch Kid. Again, I'm not sure what's going on here. Every time you block out the fact that you're watching a chick flick, something funny happens and everyone in the theater starts laughing, a high-pitched cacophony of giggles that reminds you, ""Hey, I'm at a chick flick."" That's usually when I start bludgeoning myself over the head with my 128-ounce Mountain Dew. Anyway, on a scale of 1 to 10, I'd give ""Riding Cars with Boys"" a minus-13. Let's forget this section ever happened ... and if you're attending any showings of ""Serendipity"" in the Boston area over the next few weeks and see someone who looks like me, please don't make eye contact with that person. For everyone's sake. 6. I think the Tom Brady Era is taking the Ewing Theory to the next level, especially considering that your buddy Sports Guy predicted a Ewing-resurgence for the Patriots before Week 3. You had the overhyped, overvalued superstar who never really won anything and received an inordinate amount of media attention and fan hype (Drew Bledsoe). You had the requisite injury during the season that caused everyone to write the team off (Bledsoe going down in Week 2, possibly for the season). You had everyone writing the team off. And then ... You had the team immediately running off a 3-1 streak, including two ""I can't believe this is happening!"" wins (both over Indy), as well as an improbable comeback win (over San Diego), showing more life than they've shown in years. Now you have the local media searching for answers to explain how a team can lose its franchise player and ""inexplicably"" start playing better. And everyone keeps saying that the Patriots have come out of nowhere. You know better. Just for the record, I officially abandoned my seat on the Bledsoe Bandwagon at 2:30 on Sunday afternoon, when the Pats took a 28-6 lead in Indianapolis, and I called my father just to pretend I was Paul Tagliabue, announcing, ""With the first pick of the 2002 expansion draft, the Houston Texans select ... Drew Bledsoe, quarterback, New England Patriots."" (Sounds far-fetched? Remember, they signed Bledsoe to a mammoth contract extension last spring; they couldn't trade him without absorbing an impossible salary cap hit. But according to NFL rules, any player who gets selected in the expansion draft has his contract and cap figure transferred to the Texans -- even the pro-rated bonus payments -- which means the Pats could leave Bledsoe unprotected and hope the Texans gobble him up, which would clear $10 million to $12 million in cap space to spend in free agents next spring. Mmmmmm ... cap space ...) 7. I think Tampa Bay and Indianapolis should trade coaches -- Dungy straight-up for Jim Mora. Why don't teams ever trade coaches in sports? What's the worst thing that could happen? What about Marty Schottenheimer and two Schottenheimers to be named later for George Seifert and cash? Couldn't this work or am I crazy? 8. I think Buffalo's Travis Henry always looks like one of those stubborn buffaloes on the Discovery Channel that fight off four or five cheetahs before they finally get dragged down. Last week against the Jaguars, he had 57 carries for 65 yards even though he was hit three yards behind the line by four defenders on every carry. High comedy. His career might not last until November at this rate. 9. I think Chicago and Pittsburgh are shaping up as the ""Out of Nowhere Teams"" in each conference this season -- those basement teams that beef up against crappy opponents, shock the experts, win 10-11 games and scare the heck out of the bookmakers in Vegas (given that they were long shots to win it all before the season). Both teams run the ball effectively, avoid taking chances on offense, swarm the ball on defense and make plays on special teams; in other words, they're following Baltimore's 2000 playbook to a tee. Chicago's resurgence wasn't that improbable, given that somebody strange was coming out of the NFC Central ... but Pittsburgh? Did you ever envision them at 4-1, when four of their first five were on the road? Now they finish up with seven of their last 11 at home. Yikes. It's almost enough to make you forget that Kordell Stewart's still involved. Almost. Keep in mind, just in case the Bears or Steelers stumble over the next few weeks, there are an inordinate amount of other ""Out of Nowhere"" candidates: San Fran (4-1), San Diego (4-2), Cleveland (4-2), Atlanta (3-3) and New England (3-3). For all we know, all of those teams might make the playoffs this season ... but the schedule seems to favor Chicago and Pittsburgh over everyone else. For all we know, all of those teams might sneak into the playoffs. It's been that kind of season. 10. I think that ""Any Given Sunday"" was a flawed movie, to say the least, crippled by brutal editing, suicidal casting decisions and a script that meandered all over the place. And yet one scene makes it all worth it. You know the one. It's the scene when Al Pacino (as coach Tony DeMarco) throws the movie on his back before the Big Game: ""You know, when you get old in life, things get taken from you. That's part of life. But you only learn that when you start losing stuff. You find out that life's a game of inches. So is football. Because in either game, life or football, the margin for error is so small. I mean, one half a step too late, or too early, and you don't quite make it. One half-second too slow or too fast, you don't quite catch it. The inches we need are everywhere around us. They're in every break of the game, every minute, every second."" (Now the players are clapping ...) ""On this team, we fight for that inch. On this team, we tear ourselves and everyone around us for that inch. We claw with our fingernails for that inch. Because we know that when we add up all those inches, we know that's gonna make the #$%#@& difference between winning and losing! Between living?and dying!""??(Now the players are screaming along with every word...)??""I'll tell you this -- in any fight, it's the guy who's willing to die who's?gonna win that inch ... Now I can't make you do it. You gotta look at the?guy next to ya, look into his eyes, and I think you're gonna see a guy who?will go that inch with you.""??(The light bulb finally clicks for enigmatic QB Willie Beamon ... he strolls?toward his coach, inspired ...)??""You're gonna see a guy who will sacrifice himself for this team because he?knows when it comes down to it, you're gonna do the same for him. That's a?team, gentleman. And either we heal, now, as a team ... or we will die as?individuals. That's football, guys. That's all it is.""??(Dramatic pause)??""Now, what are you gonna do?""??(Complete Pandemonium in the locker room. Chills galore. And the team bursts?out of the locker room in slow motion ...)??And I can't think of a better way to end this column.???/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/???Back to ""Serious Stuff"" now...??Joe??/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/??Bryant Analytics, Inc.

Joe /**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/ Broncos Don't Trade Gary Due to Health of Davis Entire story: http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/football/news/2001/10/23/ravens_broncos_ap/ Clipped from the Don Banks article: As has become the norm, the NFL trading deadline passed Tuesday without a move. But a headline deal that would have sent Denver running back Olandis Gary to the defending Super Bowl champion Ravens nearly came to fruition Monday, according to sources within the Baltimore organization. The Ravens senior vice president of football operations Ozzie Newsome and Broncos general manager Neal Dahlen spoke several times Monday and had in place the framework of a trade that would have sent Gary and a fourth-round pick in 2002 to the Ravens for reserve defensive tackle Lionel Dalton and Baltimore's second-round selection next year. But the deal-breaker, according to Ravens sources, was the ever-confusing issue of Terrell Davis' health. Ravens officials believe their deal with Denver was alive until late in the afternoon, when Broncos head coach Mike Shanahan became convinced that he could not count on Davis to return to health this year, even as a backup to starter Mike Anderson. It is believed that Davis himself on Monday may have nixed the trade of Gary by informing Shanahan that he is uncertain when he will be able to play again. Davis has been out since requiring arthroscopic surgery on his troubled right knee following Denver's season-opening win against the Giants. Baltimore officials said there were some indications coming from the Broncos that Davis may have a new setback in the form of a stress fracture injury, similar to the one he suffered in his lower left leg last year. Davis was expected to miss six weeks after having surgery to remove debris and repair a small cartilage tear on Sept. 20. Davis, who gained 101 yards on 21 carries in the Broncos' opener, missed 24 of 33 games in 1999-2000 due to leg injuries. The Broncos have described his right knee troubles as a degenerative condition, and it was thought that Shanahan was not counting on Davis as anything other than a fallback option this season behind Anderson and Gary. Anderson tore his right anterior cruciate ligament in 1999, then suffered ankle and stress fracture injuries in his left leg last year. This is the second time in about six months that the Ravens and Broncos have gotten close to a deal for a running back, only to have Denver back away in the end. On the first day of the NFL draft in late April, the Broncos were offering Anderson to the Ravens in exchange for a second-round pick. Baltimore officials said they were agreeable, but that Shanahan changed his mind and pulled the offer off the table. Sources say some within the Ravens organization feel twice burned at this point in terms of trade talks with Denver. Gary, 26, is the youngest running back in the Broncos' stable of three 1,000-yard rushers. He gained 1,159 yards in just 12 games after replacing the injured Davis in 1999, then saw his 2000 season cut to just one game by an ACL injury. He is currently Anderson's backup. Gary's contract with Denver ends after this season. The team has not made much progress toward an extension. Anderson's deal was extended just before the Broncos' season-opening game. Baltimore has been involved in off-again, off-again trade talks with Denver about Gary since Aug. 8, when it lost its leading rusher, Jamal Lewis, to a season-ending ACL injury. The Ravens signed veteran Terry Allen to replace Lewis, and Baltimore has been making do with a combination of Allen and second-year veteran Jason Brookins. Baltimore officials say the Broncos instigated the latest round of trade communication, contacting the Ravens to re-start the Gary talks in recent days. Considered the AFC's top two Super Bowl contenders, both teams are underachieving at 3-3 and coming off consecutive road losses. Davis has practiced the last two weeks on the Broncos scout team, and originally was expected to return in time for the Nov. 5 game at Oakland. But on Monday, Shanahan held out the possibility that Davis could return a week early, in time for Sunday's game against the New England Patriots. Davis' showing in practice this week would make the determination, Shanahan said. [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [  OUR VIEW  ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] Are these guys worth the headache?   I think not.   I'd expect some rebuttal / denial from the Denver side this morning to follow.   Don Banks is well respected and of course, Sports Illustrated is at the top of our game but I'm always a little leery of the unnamed ""Raven sources"".   Could be sour apples on a trade that didn't go right for them.   Or it could be exactly how it is.   Bottom line is this certainly doesn't look good for Davis owners.   Let's see what the Broncos say and you can go from there. Of course, you can always do the smart thing and rid yourselves of any Denver RBs.   Not promising you'll win your league but you may come out ahead with the money you save on Rolaids... More today. Joe Thanks to Footballguy Chris Smith (Smitty on our message boards) for pointing me to this one. /**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/ Bryant Analytics, Inc.

bryant@cheatsheets.net,0,0,0.9,1379e6e0-c712-45d4-af01-9c76a245d458,"body: Hi Folks, As if the Denver RB situation wasn't already goofy enough with Terrell Davis getting close to being ready, ESPN's John Clayton is now reporting that Olandis Gary could get the start this week in an effort to shake the offense up. Anderson did have a fumble Sunday which drew the ire of Shanahan. It might be worth making a move for Gary in your league if you can grab him cheaply.   But I'm not excited yet.   More likely, you can use this info to taunt the Gary / Davis / Anderson owners in your league... More as we hear it. Joe /**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/ Bryant Analytics, Inc.

bryant@cheatsheets.net,0,0,0.9,adf3a8ff-ea53-4c9a-ab65-c28223045087,"body: As you may know, we're fortunate to have several Physicians ""on staff"" (amazing what a T-shirt and cap will do...).   Seriously, these guys are not just Fantasy Football Junkies, they're Physicians who deal with these types of injuries for a living.   Every once in a while, we'll get one of our Docs to share some insights.   Today is one of those times. One of our readers in a dynasty league asked me today whether Marcus Robinson's ACL / LCL injury was worse than Germane Crowell's Patella Tendon injury.   I may not know a lot but I know when I'm over my head so this question was immediately passed on to Footballguy.com Physician, Dr. C.J. Coshal, MD. Here's his reply: Hi Joe, Good question.    Glad to help.    First, both of these are season ending injuries.    ACL injuries used to be career enders, but no more. With more refined surgery and stapling techniques the ACL can be repaired. It however is the major stabilizing ligament to the knee joint and it takes a lot of rehab to get back the mobility and feeling comfortable so that the repair is going to support you when you cut.    That is why most guys with ACL injuries; come back the next year but don't do as well as the second year after the injury. If it had just been Marcus' LCL or MCL there was a chance he could have made it back this season but paired with the ACL, it was a fatal blow. Although Crowell's injury ends his season - in theory, it should have far less implications for long term recovery.    First, to repair this you don't even need to open the knee joint.    The repair is done by stapling the tendon to the top of the main bone in the lower leg - the tibia.    Anytime you can avoid opening a joint space, recovery is quicker.    Now it will still take a lot of rehab - thousands of leg lifts without and then with weights but once the muscle strength is regained from just nonuse - the leg will be strong and stable.    It will be much less affected by cutting, etc. The biggest problem for Germane is to be aggressive with strength conditioning so it doesn't limit his jumping ability.    He's pretty tall so even if he loses a couple of vertical leap inches it wont be that noticeable. So to make this short and sweet - anytime you have a choice between players with these two injuries occurring at the same time you can bet A) The ACL / MCL / LCL injury will take longer to recover from B) That ACL / MCL / LCL injury has more implications for running and cutting after the catch. Where the art of medicine enters into this is that two different individuals will approach their rehab differently.    Someone with a more serious injury and a more diligent approach to their recovery can still surprise you.    My best guess, Crowell will come back strong by early next season.    Robinson will be slower to recover and you have to see how that affects him.    Can he regain pre-injury form? - Yes, but probably not for 1 1/2 - 2 years. Hope that helps. By the way, I am not surprised at Hearst's recovery as I predicted but you still have to admire the sheer patience and determination it must have taken.  Sounds like good qualities for a RB.  Unfortunately for Robert Edwards, he had the heart but there are some injuries you CANT come back from. I am also less than surprised at Eddie George's slow start.    I think everyone underestimated his toe injury - it sounds like such a little thing right?    Well, put your foot on the floor and push off - where does all the weight go --to the base of your toes.    I think he can still have good games but probably not till the second half of the season. /**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/ Thanks Doc!   You da Man.

ESPN.com is reporting that Detroit WR Germane Crowell is out for the season with a knee injury.   From ESPN.com :  ""Detroit coach Marty Mornhinweg said Crowell probably will not be able to play again this season."" This probably boosts the value of WR Johnnie Morton but clearly decreases the value of QB Charlie Batch who seemed to connect well with Crowell.

bryant@cheatsheets.net,0,0,0.898,1590196a-995b-433f-928d-d7ac6b4fd9d3,"body: Robinson Done for Season Entire story:   http://espn.go.com/nfl/news/2001/1022/1267465.html Clipped from the ESPN.com article: CHICAGO -- The Chicago Bears are off to a surprising 4-1 start, but their latest victory may have come at a high price. ESPN Radio 1000 in Chicago is reporting that Bears wide receiver Marcus Robinson suffered a torn anterior cruciate ligament and medial collateral ligament in his left knee in Sunday's win over the Cincinnati Bengals and will miss the rest of the season. Robinson had to be carted off the field with six minutes left in the first half after he injured the knee. The Bears did not disclose the severity of the injury after the game. The reported injury is a major blow for Robinson, who was coming off back surgery after missing the final four games of the 2000 season with a bulging disc. Robinson ranked second on the team with 23 catches for 269 yards and two touchdowns this season. Rookie David Terrell, Chicago's first-round pick, and Dez White likely will share the starting receiver's spot in Robinson's absence. Marty Booker is the Bears' leading receiver with 30 receptions for 331 yards and three touchdowns. Robinson, 26, emerged as one of the top receivers in the NFL in 1999, setting a Bears single-season record with 1,400 yards receiving and 84 receptions along with nine touchdowns. Robinson's yardage total was second overall in the NFC. In 11 games last season, Robinson had 55 catches for 738 yards and five touchdowns. The Bears have won four straight games for the first time since 1995 and matched their best start since 1991 with Sunday's 24-0 blanking of Cincinnati. [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [  OUR VIEW  ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] Clearly a tough break.   Rookie David Terrell looked like a guy ready to elevate his game to the ""next level"" yesterday.   Now his rapid development (and production) will be a necessity instead of a luxury.   More as we hear it. Thanks to Footballguy Paul Troy for the lead on this one.

no.address@enron.com,1,1,0.901,ad2b3608-6ca3-4141-b3fa-26b9d58ed889,"body: Today we announced the appointment of Jeff McMahon as Enron's chief financial officer.  In my continued discussions with the financial community yesterday and today, it became clear that this move was required to restore investor confidence.  Jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of Enron.  He is already on the job and hard at work on the issues before us.  Andy Fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company.   Jeff had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets. He joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office as chief financial officer for Enron's European operations.  Upon returning to the U.S., Jeff was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp.  In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Enron Net Works. I know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share price.  I am too, and we are working very hard to turn it around.  Appointing Jeff as CFO is one important step in that process.  But most of the solution involves just continuing to do our jobs with excellence.  The fundamentals of our business are strong, and I think the market will begin to see that as we continue to perform. Please join me in giving Jeff your full support, and thank you for all of your continued hard work. subject: Jeff McMahon Named CFO "
bryant@cheatsheets.net,0,0,0.901,b545df65-34c5-4564-a218-f24a57a1c62f,"body: Hi Folks, I know some of you have roster submission deadlines within the hour and I wanted to throw this out. KTCK 1310 in Dallas has confirmed to Footballguys.com that Dallas QB Anthony Wright may require surgery on his knee.   It's apparently not responding to treatment as they'd hoped.   If it happens, this would put the starting job in the hands of Clint Stoerner or Ryan Leaf... If that's the case, I'd have to think this can't be good for anybody. Emmitt Smith has a chance with Wright throwing the ball downfield but with another QB (likely to struggle) I'd think you have to downgrade all the Cowboys.   More as we hear it. Joe Thanks to Footballguy Gary Slinkard for pointing me to this one. /**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/ If you want to know more about the QB situation than anyone can possibly want to know, here's a detailed article from Mickey Spagnola: Entire story: http://www.dallascowboys.com/cgi-bin/Cowboys/news_mickeys.jsp On one hand, the Cowboys have ""The Ryan Package."" On the other hand, they have fluid on Anthony Wright's knee. Could the two be fixin' to collide this week? Well, let's try to answer that, and a whole lot more, as we catch up with these 1-4 Cowboys who reconvened here at The Ranch on Monday following this past weekend's inactivity. Yes, Anthony Wright did practice on Monday after missing last week's only two practices with fluid on his knee. He seemed to throw well. But he didn't have to run around much, and after practice this excess fluid on Wright's right knee that was surgically reconstructed in 1997 seemed to subdue his mood. ""Some of the swelling is gone,"" said Wright, seemingly still concerned with the knee he irritated in the Monday night victory over Washington. But that reduced swelling did not seem to placate Wright. He seemed worried. An MRI last Thursday suggested there was no structural damage. Wright said he was to receive another exam by the doctors on Tuesday, which should become the tell-tale check for this week. As for head coach Dave Campo, he reaffirmed his belief in Wright as the starter, and along with the Cowboys trainers, seemed confident Wright would be able to start Sunday against the Arizona Cardinals at Texas Stadium. If the swelling does not subside, in all likelihood the fluid would be drained from Wright's knee before the game. ""He's the starter, and we'll continue to get Ryan Leaf extra work, and see where we're at, at then end of the week,"" Campo said. ""(Leaf) is No. 3 right now, but we'll see."" That would seem to be the crack in the door, suggesting the Cowboys would rather go with Ryan Leaf as the starter if the knee gets in Wright's way this week rather than Clint Stoerner. Say what you want, that's the difference between 18 NFL starts and no NFL starts. ""They want to put a package together that I'm confident in,"" said Leaf, who took the first team snaps in last week's two practices. ""The Ryan package I guess. Right now, it's getting bigger and bigger every day. They certainly seem to want me out there when I'm ready."" And it certainly seems Leaf is doing all he can to get ready as soon as possible. He comes here early. He leaves late. He works on his off day, and even though he did take this past weekend off, the fourth-year quarterback at least took his playbook with him. ""I'm just eating it alive,"" Leaf said of his extra work. ""I took my playbook home,"" as he talked about how he and his wife, Nicole, would go through the playbook together, and that he'll live in a hotel until she gets them moved into an apartment here in Dallas. There is no time to waste. So then, knowing there is a Ryan Package, and knowing Wright's knee isn't right just yet, would Leaf be ready to start on Sunday against the Cards if Wright wasn't? ""That's probably asking a lot,"" Leaf said. ""Clint knows the offense well, and would deserve to start. But I'll be as ready as I can."" And if asked by the coaching staff if he was ready to start, Leaf said, ""I probably couldn't do as many things, but I'll never say no."" And for a guy who hasn't experienced much success in the league, at least not what you'd have expected from the second pick in the 1998 draft, at least that's a good sign. He hasn't lost any confidence in himself.... Speaking of his first three seasons in the league, and a shoulder injury robbed Leaf of his 1999 season in San Diego, he's thrown 13 touchdown passes and been intercepted 33 times while starting 18 of 21 games. The guy taken in front of him in that 1998 draft, Peyton Manning, threw 52 touchdown passes and was intercepted 43 times while starting 32 of 32 games his first two seasons. And bringing it closer to home, Troy Aikman threw 20 touchdown passes and was intercepted 36 times his first two seasons.... Knowing what you knew about the Cowboys defense going into the season, would you have given that unit a snowball's chance in hell of having a higher NFL ranking than say Tampa Bay, Tennessee and the New York Football Giants going into Monday's night game to complete Week 6 of play? Get out of here. But it says right here in these NFL rankings the Dallas Cowboys are 13th, giving up 309.6 yards a game. And it says Tampa Bay is 14th, the Giants 15th going into their Monday night game with Philadelphia, Denver 16th and Jacksonville 17th. Tennessee? Good gosh, the Titans are 26th. Come on, those are teams littered with Pro Bowl defenders. Bet they aren't starting a fourth-round pick and a sixth-rounder at cornerbacks. And remember, that's Randall Godfrey starting at middle linebacker for the league's 26th-ranked defense, not Dat Nguyen. But then the Cowboys did get to play Washington.... /**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/ Bryant Analytics, Inc.

Despite having DJ?ed full time since 1980, appearing at over 600 international clubs and events, having played for about half a million people, he is still as busy as ever and in demand like never before. Certainly one of the most eclectic DJ's around at the club and festival level, John is well known for his vast record collection of over 40,000 pieces of vinyl. Spanning a rather significant period of club music and 12"" culture, sometimes even still ""dropping"" a classic or old track along with the new. He is one of the very few DJ's who can enhance a room as well as appeal to a number of different crowds on different levels which explains his high demand. John began his international career in 1989 with Richie Hawtin by founding the world renown Plus 8 Records. John and Richie not only launched their own careers but also those of Dan Bell as the trio Cybersonik, Kenny Larkin, and Speedy J to mention just a few of the artists. They have also founded Defintive records to feature house music and artists launching the likes of Robotman, Barada, Omegaman and others. Although noted mostly for his DJ?ing, John was actively involved as engineer, producer and artist in the formative years and has compiled and extensive and impressive discography. The last few years has seen a number of changes to the club and party scene. Evolving as ever, the international scene has settled down with DJ's taking on club residencies. John was at the forefront of this trend and over the last two years, not only has he played in every inhabited continent excluding Africa, but you can also find him monthly at Florida 135 in Barcelona Spain and the Twilo club in New York. Cities that regularly appear on john?s itinerary every two to three months are: San Francisco USA (Nikita and Spundaes ), Montreal Canada (Sona ), Essen Germany (Tanzhaus-ex Rote Liebe ), Dusseldorf Germany (Unique ). With this regular performance base, the rest of the time is spent trying to fill requests from clubs primarily from Europe and now in North America as well as all over the world. John has had a quiet but still excellent history for production work. The most notable release of late is a DJ mix CD. ""From Saturday to Sunday mix"" is his best mix CD to date and was done with the cooperation of John's Spanish club where he is resident: Florida 135. It captures John over two sessions and is the best example of his mixing and DJ sound to date  _______________________________________________________________________ Powered by List Builder To unsubscribe follow the link: http://lb.bcentral.com/ex/manage/subscriberprefs?customerid=6913&subid=D7DF5E12DBF95EEA&msgnum=68 subject: FRIDAY ITS PURE CHICAGO @ HYPERIA "
info@clubhyperia.com,0,0,0.901,f41f50e9-5cbc-4f46-a93f-02223a44bcb1,"body: THURSDAY OCT 25th SEB FONTAINE GLOBAL UNDERGROUND = PROTOTYPE- CD Release Tour  Seb Fontaine has rescheduled his appearance at HYPERIA. This October, 25th, the global domination of this heavily demanded DJ Stops in Houston at Hyperia! Seb has dance music in his blood from the day he was conceived in Ibiza - his mother is a semi-professional DJ. Growing up in West London, Seb?s initial musical development was stimulated by ska, but soon dropped out of sixth form college to pursue a career as a DJ. His first ?proper? gig was at Crazy Larry?s on the Kings Road, getting paid ?30 a night to spin tunes for a typical Eighties ?sloanie? crew. By 1989, Seb landed a residency at The Fridge, Brixton, where he played mainly hip hop and rare groove, swiftly followed a year later by a residency at The Wag, playing ragga, rare groove and acid. Next came a residency at Subterania, alongside Norman Jay and Jeremy Healy. In 1993, Seb gained his first house residency at Glitterati at The Cross. Malibu Stacey was the next stop for Seb - a night he put together and promoted at the Hanover Grand with friend Craig Richards. As Malibu got more established, Seb got increasingly restless, and took to the road in a big way, focusing more and more outside of London, becoming one of the UK?s hardest working ?motorway jocks?. At the same time, music becomes harder and deeper. In 1998, Seb was offerred a fortnightly residency at Cream, which soon became a weekly gig. In 1999, Seb took Ibiza by storm, with Cream at Amnesia. Seb Fontaine clinched the deal with Radio 1 in February 2000, initially to deputise for dance shows exclusively on Radio 1, gaining him the nickname ?super-sub?. He also joins Radio 1 in its mammoth summer of live music at the major dance festivals, and at the station?s own Radio 1 Dance Parties. _______________________________________________________________________ Powered by List Builder To unsubscribe follow the link: http://lb.bcentral.com/ex/manage/subscriberprefs?customerid=6913&subid=77F49C02011AEC90&msgnum=67 subject: SEB FOUNTAINE !!! @ HYPERIA "

In order to keep our organization optimally structured and to facilitate additional growth, we are making the following changes: Producer/Wellhead Group  The current mid-market, origination and wellhead pricing activity currently within the Central and Eastern Gas Regions will be consolidated with the Derivatives group under Fred Lagrasta.  This will create a single business unit focused upon the needs of the producing industry within the Eastern U.S.  The producer focus in the Western U.S. and Texas will remain unchanged reporting  to Mark Whitt and Brian Redmond respectively. Strategic Asset  Development Laura Luce will move from her role in the Central Region to lead an effort focused strictly on identifying and entering into long-term strategic arrangements within the Central and Eastern Regions.  This initiative will focus on a limited number of selected markets that provide strategic opportunities for partnering in asset development, asset management and optimization.  This effort will continue to work very closely with the regional leads. Central Origination and Mid-Market Frank Vickers will continue his current role in the Eastern Region and will assume the leadership role for Mid-Market and Origination activity in the Central Region.    There will be no changes to the West and Texas Origination groups headed respectively by Barry Tycholiz and Brian Redmond.  Please join us in congratulating Fred, Laura and Frank in their new roles.

Questions on Davis' Health Linger Entire story: http://www.rockymountainnews.com/drmn/broncos/article/0,1299,DRMN_17_857787, 00.html Clipped from the Aaron Lopez article: Terrell Davis has enough trouble staying healthy without other people creating new injuries for him.   Five weeks removed from arthroscopic knee surgery, the Denver Broncos running back was taken by surprise Wednesday when told of news reports saying he may have a stress fracture in his leg and could be lost for the season. ``At this point in time, I'm on schedule to play this Sunday,'' Davis said. Davis, who has missed five games this year and 29 since 1999, admitted that his right knee remains sore, but he has been well enough to play on the scout team the past two weeks. He was part of Denver's offense Wednesday as the Broncos (3-3) prepared for this week's game against the New England Patriots (3-3). Davis was listed as questionable on the weekly injury report. ``Some days he feels good, other days he feels bad,'' coach Mike Shanahan said. ``Is he going to be back this week? Until he actually says, `Hey I'm ready to go and I'm close to 100 percent,' it's all speculation.'' The speculation was rampant Wednesday when the CNNSI.com and the Baltimore Sun reported that a potential trade between Denver and the Baltimore Ravens fell through because of uncertainty about Davis' health. Both stories, citing unidentified NFL and Ravens officials, said the Broncos were reluctant to trade backup running back Olandis Gary because they were worried Davis may not return this season. The Internet report said Davis may have personally quashed the deal by telling Shanahan he was unsure about his status for the rest of the season. Davis denied speaking with Shanahan about the trade. ``It's difficult because my knee is sore. Can I say my knee will never be sore again? I can't comment on things I have no control over,'' Davis said. ``As far as it being a stress fracture, at this point, no it's not. Does it get sore at times? Yes it does, but I don't know what that means.'' Finally thought to be healthy, Davis ran for 101 yards in Denver's season-opener but needed surgery 10 days later to remove debris from his knee. Tests since Sept. 20 have shown Davis' legs to be structurally sound. ``We check everything out,'' Shanahan said. ``Every X-ray or MRI we've given him has been negative, but we'll keep on looking at it, and hopefully he'll be back some time this season. But I can't give you a time frame because I don't know.'' In the meantime, the Broncos will continue to use Gary and Mike Anderson in the backfield. Both have maintained that they are merely keeping Davis' spot warm until he returns to health. ``He's really frustrated. Everyone would be,'' Gary said. ``He's got a thing where he wants to get back on the field and show his critics and the guys who have supported him alike that he's back, and he's 100 percent.'' [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [  OUR VIEW  ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] We told you this morning to be leery of the ""unnamed Raven sources"" and that you could expect a rebuttal / denial from Denver.   Here it is pretty much like clockwork.   What to believe?   I believe it's a very dicey situation here and I'd avoid it if I could.   If you can't, it's my guess (and it's honestly a guess) that this week you'll see mostly Anderson with Gary having an increased presence and very little Terrell Davis. Something tells me we'll be talking about this soon... Joe Thanks to Footballguy Darren Patz for pointing me to this one. /**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/ Bryant Analytics, Inc.

Circumstances demand rapid reassessments of near-term risks and strategies. In response to client requests, CERA is undertaking a comprehensive, new initiative to develop a framework for understanding potential energy futures and their implications.  This special multiclient project will include interactive analyses, face-to-face workshops, and real-time updates. It will draw on CERA's broad industry and regional expertise, offering participants both a framework and a robust tool for evaluating strategies across all sectors of the energy business and all geographies. The focus will be on creating new and highly relevant insights into the energy future and the political and economic context. It will highlight both key trends and probable discontinuities -- and assess urgent issues in a setting that will promote thoughtful and informed dialogue. By emphasizing both virtual and in-person exchanges among participating members and CERA experts, we will establish a three-year road map for decision makers across the energy business, to complement CERA's industry-specific and shorter-term analyses. In addition, the process will offer a unique opportunity to interact with others across the energy spectrum and to share ideas and experiences. * Could the economic slowdown be prolonged and inflation be rekindled? * What is the impact on energy demand -- does the fuel mix shift? * How great are the risks for disruptions of supply? In which countries and for which fuels? * How would disruptions play out?  And how tumultuous will they be for energy companies? * How will energy policies change -- relative to energy security, environmental trade-offs, and fuel strategies? * Will the global coalition hold, or are we moving to a more divided and more fractured world? * How profound will be the changes for the energy business? This timely series provides a three-year horizon that draws on the framework established in CERA's longer-term scenarios. It uses the clash between the ""Fragmentation"" and ""Globality"" scenarios as the starting point for assessing the new world in which energy-decision makers will operate and the critical choices they will face. The first workshop will be held in Houston on November 15, in conjunction with CERA's Fall Roundtable series.  Additional workshops, both in Houston and other cities and via online technologies, will follow. We will announce the entire schedule, with events and deliverables, soon. The process will deliver a clear framework for anticipating the future, and conclusions for energy strategy.

Most indications are that he'll be able to go next week.   WR Matthew Hatchette will become the other WR opposite Laveranues Coles and should do well.   Hatchette's been looking for an opportunity and this could well be it. More as we hear it.

bryant@cheatsheets.net,0,0,0.901,caa118d7-2bdd-4e78-afec-ae1eb3cd8e7c,"body: Hi Folks, Getting new information on the Wayne Chrebet situation.   Appears that Rookie WR Kevin Swayne will get the start and not Matthew Hatchette. Here's the story from Bloomberg: East Rutherford, New Jersey, Oct. 24 (Bloomberg) -- New York Jets receiver Wayne Chrebet and defensive tackle Shane Burton will miss this Sunday's game against the Carolina Panthers because of injuries sustained in last weekend's loss to St. Louis. Chrebet has had migraine headaches following a hit to his head from defensive tackle Brian Young in a 34-14 defeat this past Sunday. Chrebet, who had a concussion the previous week against Miami, didn't sustain a second concussion against the Rams, Jets coach Herman Edwards said. Chrebet has started all six games this season and is fourthon the Jets with 15 catches for 226 yards. The seven-year National Football League veteran had 69 catches for 937 yards and eight touchdowns last season. With Chrebet out, Kevin Swayne will start along with Laveranues Coles when the Jets (3-3) visit the Panthers (1-5) on Sunday. Swayne, an undrafted rookie from Wayne State in Nebraska, has one catch for 16 yards this year. [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [  OUR VIEW  ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] I'd expect to see more than usual from Hatchette but it's Swayne who's been backing up Chrebet.   Tough to expect the rookie to do a lot being thrust into this situation so I wouldn't count on too much.   Sorry for the confusion. Thanks to Footballguy Matt Rosenthal for setting me straight.

Although every effort is taken to ensure the information on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) is as accurate as possible, it may be that your structure was inadvertently included in the Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA). If your house is located on property that has a lowest adjacent grade (lowest ground touching the structure) elevation at or above the base (1-percent-annual-chance) flood elevation (BFE), you may wish to request a Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA) in accordance with Part 70 of the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) regulations. If your house was raised by fill at or above the BFE, you could request a Letter of Map Revision Based on Fill (LOMR-F) in accordance with Section 65.5 of the NFIP regulations. If FEMA issues a LOMA or LOMR-F and removes the SFHA designation from your house, the Federal flood insurance purchase requirement will no longer apply. You may then be eligible for a refund of the flood insurance premium paid on the current policy year. However, lenders retain the prerogative to require flood insurance for all properties as part of their regular lending practice, so you may want to check with your lender before requesting a LOMA or LOMR-F. subject: "

bryant@cheatsheets.net,0,0,0.899,ef37f7d4-92bc-4124-b9b8-06a3ef7cf05a,"body: Hi Folks, Lots of shifting with RBs lately on several teams and wanted to bring you the latest info as you manage your teams. Let's jump to it. Joe /**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/ Chicago's Dick Jauron - ""We don't want to be a single-back running team Entire story: http://chicagosports.com/bears/content/story/0,1984,165380,00.html Clipped from the Fred Mitchell article: Hop on the ""A Train."" Bears players and fans are climbing aboard. But the coaching staff still seems to be standing in line, waiting to have its ticket punched. Anthony Thomas rushed for a Bears rookie-record 188 yards in 22 carries for an 8.5-yard average and one touchdown Sunday. But those remarkable accomplishments during the Bears' 24-0 trouncing of the Bengals merely earned Thomas the designation of ""the hot back"" of the week in the eyes of Bears coaches. Thomas' 188 yards rank eighth all time among all Bears rushers. It was the sixth-best rushing effort against a Bengals team. ""We like our tandem,"" said coach Dick Jauron. ""We don't want to be a single-back running team. I believe James Allen is pretty good. Whoever is hot ... if he's hot, he'll get more carries."" Allen, a fourth-year veteran from Oklahoma, rushed for 163 yards in a game against Baltimore in 1998, only to have then-Bears coach Dave Wannstedt say, ""Let's not put him in the Hall of Fame just yet."" Thomas alternated with Allen for the first several series Sunday until Thomas clearly outperformed the veteran. Allen wound up with 17 yards on seven carries (2.4 average). His longest run was 5 yards. Thomas had a long run of 46 yards, as well as a 23-yard touchdown jaunt. ""The offensive line did a great job,"" Thomas said. ""They were opening up lanes that probably anybody could run through. Every time you go out, you want to get better."" Thomas routinely bulled his way through the Bengals' defense, requiring several players to bring him down. ""The guy can pound the football,"" said quarterback Jim Miller of the second-round draft pick out of Michigan. ""He has good feet, he's big (6 feet 1 inch, 230 pounds) and he powers it forward. We knew he was going to be good. It was just a matter of time. He's a smart kid. He has picked up the offense very well."" Miller connected on 23-of-30 passes for 232 yards and two touchdowns. But it was the running game that buoyed the Bears' offense, which netted 435 yards. ""You just kind of go with the guy who's hot,"" said Miller, echoing the sentiment of the coaching staff. ""Anthony was just so hot and running so well and they were having a hard time tackling him. The coaches just kind of made a decision to go with the hot back. We're going to need James too. We want to get to the point where there's a 1-2 punch."" The Bengals' defense looked punchy in the second half. Thomas had 110 yards in only nine carries at halftime. ""Come the fourth quarter, those guys couldn't stop him,"" Miller said. ""Our offensive line was kicking their fannies again. You could just see it on the field. That defensive line wanted no part of our offensive line. They were abusing those guys."" Jauron praised Thomas' performance but seemed to want to evaluate his effort within the team concept. ""We called his number more during the game,"" Jauron said. ""But in every game we have 'x' number of plays earmarked for him. Sometimes you don't get to them all."" It was in an exhibition game against the Bengals on Aug. 4 that Thomas hurt his knee, setting him back in training camp. Sunday's record showing raises the bar of expectations for Thomas, who hadn't rushed for more than 58 yards previously in the NFL. ""I know some of the guys who played, like Gale Sayers and Walter Payton,"" Thomas said. ""And it's a compliment that some of those guys didn't do this. ""It's something that's real high and something I can think about the rest of my life."" [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [  OUR VIEW  ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] Hard to tell how this will go.   We've been expecting Thomas to start stealing more and more carries but honestly didn't see this explosion coming this soon.   It seems pretty clear to me that Thomas has something special while Allen just doesn't.   This could be a ""motivation"" thing for Thomas so he keeps his head amidst the Walter Payton / Gale Sayers talk.   And it could be ""handling"" James Allen so he stays positive.   But bottom line is I think you'll continue to see good things from Thomas, just maybe not quite the full fledged feature back.   Yet. /**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/ Doug Chapman to Start Again Entire story:   http://www.startribune.com/stories/503/776670.html Clipped from the Kent Youngblood article: Michael Bennett's right ankle is sore enough that the Vikings probably won't have to worry this week how to split practice time at running back. Doug Chapman had the best game by a Vikings running back this season in Sunday's victory over Green Bay, a game in which the team had its best running game in four seasons. So the question of whom is the starter, long-term, wasn't something Vikings coach Dennis Green was worried about Monday. ""He's not ready, No. 1 ...,"" Green said of Bennett. ""So when we get to that point, we will look at it. But his ankle is not ready yet."" Bennett was doing better in straight-line running, but hasn't tested his ability to cut or move side to side. ""I just don't think he's going to be ready in one week,"" Green said. ""Ankles just don't heal, normally, in one week. He had a pretty serious ankle [injury]. He's working hard at rehabilitation, so the sooner the better."" Players normally don't lose their starting roles because of injury. But Chapman's performance Sunday certainly gave Vikings coaches confidence in his ability. ""We always knew he could run,"" running backs coach Carl Hargrave said. ""It was a matter of having an opportunity. And he took advantage of the opportunity. ... I think we're going to play things out the way they are. As long as you're healthy, you're going to stay with the healthy guy."" Chapman, who gained 90 yards on 22 carries, credited the offensive line. ""I'm glad [the line] got some confidence,"" he said. ""That's the main thing. They set the tone, protected [quarterback] Daunte [Culpepper], opened some holes for me."" Chapman likely has earned a lot of playing time even when Bennett gets healthy. But Green wasn't ready to take that issue on yet. ""The good thing is we can do it any way we want to, because we don't put the same value on starting as a lot of people do,"" Green said. ""We put it in the contribution, who is going to help us win, that's what it comes down to. ... So when it comes to that time we'll look at who is going to give us the best chance to win. That's who we'll play."" /**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/ Michael Bennett has the commanding lead for Rookie Bust of the Year.   Doug Chapman looked excellent and put to rest a lot of the finger pointing by Bennett supporters that the OL or the system was to blame.   Denny Green's not one to admit he was wrong too often so I think you'll see that ""serious ankle"" injury linger for as long as Chapman keeps performing.   Don't forget, this kid scored about 200 TDs (okay, 61...) when he was at Marshall. He's a player, so don't count him out. /**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/ Canidate to Likely Get Another Start Entire Story:   http://www.stltoday.com/stltoday/sports/ Clipped from the Nick Wishart article: Get ready for more Trung Canidate. The Rams' No. 2 running back probably will start again Sunday at home against the New Orleans Saints with Marshall Faulk expected to be a scratch for the second week in a row. ""I wouldn't expect Marshall to be up for this game,"" coach Mike Martz said Monday, adding that Faulk will be listed as questionable on the midweek injury report. ""He's got to be 100 percent before I would be convinced that we've got to let him play. And if he's not, then he doesn't play."" Faulk sat out practice last week and missed Sunday's game because of a bruised right knee suffered a week earlier against the Giants. Canidate, in his first career start, performed brilliantly in relief, rushing for 195 yards and two touchdowns in the Rams' 34-14 win over the New York Jets. Martz described Canidate's performance as a ""relief."" But, he added, ""It doesn't change whether Marshall would be up. You just can't do that. You are really running a risk. We've got so much of the season left. We've got to do the right thing. We're just going to see where he is probably Wednesday or Thursday."" [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [  OUR VIEW  ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] Looks like you Canidate owners can pony up for another week.   Clearly, this is a radically different situation than with Michael Bennett as Faulk will certainly be the starter once he's ready.   It's just that with Canidate's great performance, Coach Martz can take his time letting Faulk get back to 100%.   In a league full of teams not fulfilling expectations, you can be sure the Rams are determined to keep meeting their lofty goals and that means having Faulk at full speed for the longest time possible.   They'll face New Orleans this week and then have week 8 off for their bye.   That's even more reason not to push him back too early.   We can wring our hands in week 9 as to who'll get the carries but for me, I'd expect another week of Canidate for now.   An early matchup thought to keep in mind though:   The Jets rank # 31 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks while New Orleans ranks # 7. /**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/ Mixed Signals on Shaun Alexander Entire story: http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/sports/134357552_hawk23.html Clopped from the Percy Allen article: KIRKLAND - The key components to their offensive resurgence can be traced to a trio of Seahawks reserves that few had counted on just weeks ago. A pair of backups and a prominent castoff were thrown into starting roles and because of them, Seattle rebounded from consecutive lopsided defeats with back-to-back victories. Consider running back Shaun Alexander, quarterback Trent Dilfer and offensive tackle Todd Weiner, improbable stars for an improbable team that finds itself among the NFL's elite. And yet when 3-2 Seattle, one of six AFC teams with a winning record, meets 3-2 Miami on Sunday at Husky Stadium, Dilfer and Weiner aren't likely to be in the starting lineup. In a few weeks, Alexander will join them on the sideline when Ricky Watters recovers from a shoulder injury. An unwritten rule in the NFL says players don't lose their jobs because of injury. However, Coach Mike Holmgren admits that sometimes he follows this policy and sometimes he doesn't. ""A lot of times you get stuck when a player feels like you weren't honest with him,"" Holmgren said. ""(There's) a lot of things that can happen. Generally speaking, a veteran player who can come back and play, normally he doesn't lose his starting position. ""But every once in awhile, for whatever reasons, you might want to go one more week with a certain combination. My main concern is that the player knows what we're doing."" [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [  OUR VIEW  ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] I, for one have trouble with the ""player can't lose his job to injury"" conventional wisdom.   If Dilfer's healthy, he'd be my guy.   Although I can see Holmgren's angle if he's playing for the long term.  (Although I'd be worried about Jerry Glanville's famous quote about the NFL stands for ""Not For Long"")   The worry for Holmgren from a leadership point of view is staying consistent.   How does he bench Dilfer when Hasselbeck is ready but not bench Alexander when Watters can go?   If Holmgren is focused on the future, he could make a case that he's being consistent in keeping a long term focus.   Few people think Dilfer is the long term guy and most everyone expects Alexander to take over for Watters next season.   Therefore, he'd be playing his future guys.   You've probably got a couple more weeks before you have to worry about this but it might make a difference in your trade / free agency dealings. /**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/ That'll do it for now, Folks.

Sean ""Super Star""  sean@seanstar.com Friday, November 2nd Leave for Vegas early (make sure not to have any box cutters in your  luggage). Arrive in the ultimate party city knowing that NO ONE in the  entire town will party like we are about to.  Event I: Ultimate Fighting Championship 34 What: The largest, worldwide, Pay-Per-View event outside of boxing. Blood,  sweat, teeth, and adrenaline. It's a battle of modern day gladiator's in a  cage. Where: MGM Grand Arena (12,000 expected; based on last 4 shows that sold  out). Celebrities: Carmen Electra (spokesperson; formerly of Baywatch),  Victoria Silvestedt (Playboy Centerfold), Dennis Rodman, Mike Tyson, Limp  Bizkit, Dave Navarro (Red Hot Chili Peppers), and too many to mention. OUR STATUS: Secured VIP. All access Press Passes: ability to interview and  take photos with the celebrities and fighters, unlimited food and drinks,  promotional items such as t-shirts, hats, etc. Also, we can get possible  footage and camera time on this worldwide Pay-Per-View event. The  after-party will be full of sexy babes and national print (Rolling Stone  Magazine) and video media (MTV) like us.  Saturday, November 3rd Try to wake up after the wildest night of our lives partying with  celebrities. We have the option of going to the pre-party/press conference  for tonight or we can party at the casinos until the show.  Event II: John Huntington and John Lewis present WFA  Time: 7:00 pm (Pacific Time)-??? (There will be an outrageous  after-party) What: John Huntington is the most successful party/event promoter. He has  conceptualized the biggest theme parties such as the Pimp an' Hoe Ball  (sells out 10,000 tickets in 2 weeks), and personal parties for celebrities  such as Madonna, Guns and Roses, and Ben Affleck, among many others.  Everything he touches turns to gold. Where: Hard Rock Hotel and Casino Celebrities: John Huntington and Damian Saunders always attract  celebrities and commonly have Tommy Lee, Pam Anderson, Ben Affleck, Charlie  Sheen, and others host their parties. Wait and see. OUR STATUS: Secured VIP. All access Press Passes and VIP introductions by  the host himself to the wildest, most beautiful women in Vegas. We will be  picked up BY JOHN HUNTINGTON and JOHN LEWIS in THEIR stretch limousine!!!  Whatever happens in the limo will be our secret. Arrive at the event and  flirt with the ring girls, sexual performers, or the hundreds of babes in  attendance who want us to take their pictures. At the end of the event, we  will party like there's no tomorrow at the VIP after-party. Whatever  happens next will be something to write Playboy about.  Sunday, November 4th Speaking of Playboy, we are about to find out how Hollywood celebrities  and Rock star's party! Hugh Hefner's 30 sexiest playmates will party with  us for this unbelievable VIP party.  Event III: The PLAYBOY Open Golf Scramble Time: Early afternoon to evening (complete schedule coming soon) What: Who can party harder than Playboy? Early morning/afternoon, we'll be  drinking bellini's and mimosa's while watching Pro golfers battle for the  finals. ESPN, Sport's Illustrated, and many other media crews' will be  filming the action. We're talking about having golf cart races with Limp  Bizkit, Incubus, and Playboy Bunnies on the Golf Course. Drinking the best,  frozen margaritas and eating continental cuisine by the pool with Playboy  Bunnies, Hawaiian Tropic chicks, and surprise celebrities and rock star's.  We can all become Hugh Hefner for a few days while our photographer snaps  our pictures with over 30 centerfolds. At night, we'll be drinking,  laughing, and dancing ourselves into a bliss! You won't remember what  happened the next morning but you'll be happy! Where: Playboy TAKES OVER Caesar's Palace Hotel- we'll own the place!  Strict security will keep the paparazzi and the riff-raff out. Celebrities: Playboy won't release this information until the day of the  event but rumors are Vin Diesal (Fast and Furious, Pitch Black, Saving  Private Ryan movies), a few famous faces, and of course?us! E!  Entertainment, Maxim, and Playboy magazine will be there as well.  OUR STATUS: If you walk in with Sean Star, the red carpet to fame will  always be unrolled for you! ALWAYS VIP with Playboy, since I cover  (journalistically) all their parties worldwide. Everything has been taken  care of for our all access Press Passes. You will be treated no different  than Bill Gates or Ricky Martin! CONSIDER THIS: I'm bringing one of Houston's best photographers to follow  us around and shoot pictures of the event and all of us with celebrities,  BABES, and anything cool. You will ALL get copies of the digital and print  pictures. You will also likely be published in many magazines and websites  we contribute the content to. I will also make each of us a commemorative  photo album/binder for us all to remember this incredible experience.

Despite having DJ?ed full time since 1980, appearing at over 600 international clubs and events, having played for about half a million people, he is still as busy as ever and in demand like never before.  Certainly one of the most eclectic DJ's around at the club and festival level, John is well known for his vast record collection of over 40,000 pieces of vinyl. Spanning a rather significant period of club music and 12"" culture, sometimes even still ""dropping"" a classic or old track along with the new. He is one of the very few DJ's who can enhance a room as well as appeal to a number of different crowds on different levels which explains his high demand. John began his international career in 1989 with Richie Hawtin by founding the world renown Plus 8 Records. John and Richie not only launched their own careers but also those of Dan Bell as the trio Cybersonik, Kenny Larkin, and Speedy J to mention just a few of the artists. They have also founded Defintive records to feature house music and artists launching the likes of Robotman, Barada, Omegaman and others. Although noted mostly for his DJ?ing, John was actively involved as engineer, producer and artist in the formative years and has compiled and extensive and impressive discography.   The last few years has seen a number of changes to the club and party scene. Evolving as ever, the international scene has settled down with DJ's taking on club residencies. John was at the forefront of this trend and over the last two years, not only has he played in every inhabited continent excluding Africa, but you can also find him monthly at Florida 135 in Barcelona Spain and the Twilo club in New York.  Cities that regularly appear on john?s itinerary every two to three months are: San Francisco USA (Nikita and Spundaes ), Montreal Canada (Sona ), Essen Germany (Tanzhaus-ex Rote Liebe ), Dusseldorf Germany (Unique ).    With this regular performance base, the rest of the time is spent trying to fill requests from clubs primarily from Europe and now in North America as well as all over the world. John has had a quiet but still excellent history for production work. The most notable release of late is a DJ mix CD. ""From Saturday to Sunday mix"" is his best mix CD to date and was done with the cooperation of John's Spanish club where he is resident: Florida 135. It captures John over two sessions and is the best example of his mixing and DJ sound to date _______________________________________________________________________ Powered by List Builder To unsubscribe follow the link: http://lb.bcentral.com/ex/manage/subscriberprefs?customerid=6913&subid=385EADABB49EF768&msgnum=69 subject: PURE CHICAGO @ HYPERIA : w/ DJ John Acquaviva "

bryant@cheatsheets.net,0,0,0.904,8a7e9f16-84e0-441c-b532-a31d60e154e3,"body: Hi Folks, Like you, I'm scrambling to try and find anything on Edgerrin James this afternoon. As of 4:27 EDT, the latest I have is he says he'll be fine isn't especially worried.   I do NOT however have news on how the MRI results came back.   As soon as I do, I'll shoot to you.   If things go as they usually do, I'll get the new information about 2 minutes after I send you this update...  Oh well. Sticking with the ""You'll Know What I Know"" philosophy, here's what I have for now: http://starnews.com/print/articles/sideb26.html Clipped from the Phillip B. Wilson article: James Assures Everyone He'll Be Ready for Next Game KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- Peyton Manning had the same sinking feeling a week ago, staring in disbelief as one of the Indianapolis Colts' famed ""Triplets"" went down and stayed down with a leg injury. ""I don't like it at all,"" the Colts quarterback said. ""There's no replacement for Edgerrin James."" The durable James had his left knee bent awkwardly by Kansas City linebacker Marvcus Patton with 4:26 remaining and the Colts clinging to a 28-21 lead over the inspired Chiefs on Thursday night at Arrowhead Stadium. A grimacing James looked up and eventually caught the eye of Pro Bowl teammate Marvin Harrison, the Triplet who gave his teammates a scare when his leg buckled in the third quarter last week. ""I told him I'd be back,"" James said. James didn't make it back for the Colts' 35-28 triumph, but that wasn't his decision. He said he wanted to go back into the game. The NFL's two-time reigning rushing champion is expected to have an MRI exam today, just to be safe, but he isn't worried about being ready for the next game, Nov. 4 at Buffalo. He joked with teammates after his shower and didn't even have ice on his knee. ""I'm going to be all right,"" he said with a smile. ""Something wasn't right, I felt some pain and knew something wasn't right. Then the pain started to go away, so I knew it couldn't be too bad."" James caught everyone by surprise. The Pro Bowl runner has been as rugged as he's been consistent. He has 151 of the Colts' 184 rushing attempts this season for 662 yards. As a rookie out of the University of Miami, he had 369 carries for 1,553 yards rushing. His second year, he upped both totals to 387 carries for 1,709 yards. ""I was shook up,"" Harrison said. ""I was shook up last week when it happened to me and Edge was more worried about me. This time, I was shook up about him. ""You don't think that about Edgerrin. Him being down awhile was scary."" Manning, one of the last to enter the Colts' triumphant locker room, stopped at James' locker and tapped his tailback on the shoulder. ""How is it?"" the quarterback asked. ""I'll be all right,"" James said, for seemingly the hundredth time. Despite missing the final minutes, James finished with 102 yards rushing on 27 carries. That gives him 24 100-yard rushing games in his 38-game NFL career, tying Eric Dickerson for the most in Colts history. Colts coach Jim Mora also didn't seem worried that James' injury might be as severe as it looked on slow-motion television replays. ""I don't think it's serious,"" Mora said. ""They were in there examining a bit ago. I think he'll be OK. I can't give any prognosis about next week. We do have a little longer time to recover and hopefully he'll be ready."" On the first play of the final quarter, James broke free on third-and-one and ran 20 yards to the Chiefs' 33. It set up Mike Vanderjagt's 42-yard field goal to give the Colts a 20-14 lead with 13 minutes remaining. On the Colts' next offensive series, Manning audibled at the line of scrimmage and hit Harrison for a 47-yard touchdown pass. James added two points, catching a Manning pass in the flat and running to the left corner of the end zone to give the Colts a 28-14 lead with 8:21 left. /**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/ I'm still wanting to hear official word.   Knee injuries are weird.   The first time Jamal Anderson wrecked his knee in college, he stayed in the game a good while after the injury.   Just because James says it doesn't feel too bad, doesn't have him out of the woods yet.   Stay tuned.   If you can grab Dominic Rhodes with little cost, it might not be a bad idea.   If nothing else, it'll be fun for taunting the James owner in your league. If you hear anything on James, shoot me an email at bryant@footballguys.com and I'll spread the word the rest of the guys.

bryant@cheatsheets.net,0,0,0.904,820a2d4c-3543-4ca3-af1e-9f5168f61f40,"body: Hi Folks, Getting lots of ""what happened to Derrick Alexander?"" emails. As you may have heard, the announcers for the game last night reported that Alexander injured his ribs during pre game warm-ups.   Even the announcers were not aware of it until after kickoff.   So don't beat yourself up if you started him.   Nothing you could have done.   It's the same as if he were hurt on the first play of the game.   Not much information right now as to how serious the injury is but we'll keep you posted.   My guess is that Larry Parker's 76 yard / 2 TD performance will have a very positive effect on Alexander's recovery this week... More as we hear it.

bryant@cheatsheets.net,0,0,0.904,ca4f3313-07ef-42fd-8e95-c5e888e78edb,"body: Warrick Dunn Likely Out - Keyshawn Johnson Better Entire Story: http://www.buccaneers.com/newsroom/newspage.asp?newsid=1754&backpage= Clipped from the Buccaneers Website: Friday's practice at One Buccaneer Place started without running back Warrick Dunn, which means Sunday's game probably will, too. Dunn was still in the training room when the Tampa Bay Buccaneers began to pass and run the ball late Friday morning, and though he joined the team onfield a few minutes later, it was in sweats and running shoes. Afterward, Head Coach Tony Dungy made it clear that he does not expect Dunn to play against the Vikings this weekend, and the same holds true for WR Jacquez Green (groin strain). ""Warrick did not practice and Jacquez didn't practice,"" said Dungy. ""I would say there be doubtful, but other than that we have a shot to have everyone else. ""Really, Warrick and 'Quez, unless they had a miracle recovery, probably would not play. Right now, we're saying doubtful. We haven't ruled them out, but we're as close to that as we can be, I guess."" Friday is often the best determinant for a player's readiness for Sunday, and neither Dunn nor Green looked close to ready for the final full-scale practice of the week. Dungy was concerned both about their productiveness on Sunday and their potential for further injury. ""Today they couldn't go, couldn't run,"" he said. ""Unless they can run full speed by Sunday, we shouldn't play them. If they're not running full speed, it's tough to get anything done and you are more vulnerable (to injury)."" This is the Buccaneers' final season as part of the NFC Central Division, but Dunn keeps seeing dates on his farewell tour cancelled. A foot sprain suffered against Minnesota a month ago caused him to miss the Bucs' home opener with Green Bay on October 7. In that contest, FB Mike Alstott carried 15 times for 77 yards, including a late-game 39-yard breakaway that scored the winning points in a 14-10 decision. It is likely that Alstott will be the primary ballcarrier again this Sunday against the Vikings, though running backs Aaron Stecker and Rabih Abdullah may also get their shots. With Dunn entering the season as the designated number one rusher for the Bucs' new offense under coordinator Clyde Christensen, Alstott has found his carries somewhat limited. He has averaged just over six carries per contest so far, picking up 132 yards and one touchdown on 31 carries. He has averaged an impressive 4.3 yards per carry. Wide receiver Keyshawn Johnson, who started the week as questionable but has since been upgraded, also continued his path towards playing against the Vikings. ""Derrick practiced today and went through,"" said Dungy. ""He's doing fine and should be okay by game time, I think. Keyshawn practiced and went through. We'll see how they are tomorrow but they look like they could be able to play."" That would mean the Bucs would still have the NFC's leading receiver in the lineup, though his starting mate, Green, will probably sit the game out. If he does, fifth-year wideout Reidel Anthony would take his place. Anthony has 34 career starts with the Buccaneers, two more than Green. [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [  OUR VIEW  ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] This pretty much sums it up.   Alstott moves up of course.   Keyshawn does as well.

bryant@cheatsheets.net,0,0,0.904,0b52638e-b7df-411d-b2b4-5bdbf1e2cd5f,"body: Hi Folks, Here's the latest on the Raven Running Back situation. Brookins Looking Like the Starter Entire story:   http://www.sunspot.net/sports/football/bal-sp.ravensnotes Clipped from the Paul McMullen and Jamison Hensley article: After he was released by the Ravens and Oakland Raiders last year, Jason Brookins hooked up with the Jacksonville Jaguars' practice squad. Brookins could get his first NFL start against those same Jaguars on Sunday at PSINet Stadium. The NFL landscape keeps shifting for Brookins, the 25-year-old running back who was just trying to win a permanent spot on the Ravens' roster when training camp began. A season-ending knee injury to Jamal Lewis put Brookins in the game plan, and a less serious malady affecting Terry Allen had coach Brian Billick and the 6-foot-2, 225-pound player talking yesterday as if he would be Sunday's starter. Allen is listed as questionable on the injury report because of the sprained ankle that knocked him out of Sunday's loss to the Browns. A second-half terror in impressive wins over Denver and Tennessee, Brookins went down as meekly as the rest of the Ravens in Cleveland, where his five carries after halftime netted 6 yards. ""This is a different role for him,"" Billick said. ""He's going to have to hold up the whole game. That's something you think more about. He'll be a little hyped up. I'll have to calm him down a little bit, but stamina is something you're more concerned about."" After seeing little first-half action in the first four games, Brookins averaged 5.7 yards a carry in the second halves against the Broncos and Titans. After Allen went down early in Cleveland, Brookins entered and had eight rushes for 40 yards by halftime, and he scoffed at the suggestion that fatigue played a part in his late dropoff. ""It wasn't so much that I was tired, Cleveland's defense just buckled down in the second half,"" said Brookins, who was taken off the injury report because his shoulder injury responded to treatment. ""We had to start passing the ball, and if I could have gotten the ball more, maybe we would have had more rushing yards."" [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [  OUR VIEW  ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] We've been hyping Brookins for a while but he'd never been able to move Terry Allen out of the way.   Here's his chance.   Clearly, back off of Allen and if you're ready to roll the dice a bit, take a shot on Brookins. Joe /**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/ Bryant Analytics, Inc.

PLEASE NOTE:   See the cheatsheet online www.footballguys.com (when it's posted, Thursday) for exactly where I rank players and to determine who to start.   I always receive emails asking me how I can have a guy ranked highly on the cheatsheet but listed under a matchup that favors the Defense. Just because one matchup may be more favorable than another, that doesn't necessarily mean I'd start the player with the best matchup.   Ahman Green may have a horrible matchup one week but unless you're sitting on Edgerrin James or Marshall Faulk, Green's your guy no matter who he's lining up against.   The matchup info is meant to be just one more tool in your box when it comes to deciding between players. Stats are provided by Mike Hall's excellent FLM League Management Software. http://www.fflm.com/ for more info.   Fantasy Points Allowed by position numbers are from ESPN.com. Let's get to it. Joe /**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/ Rushing Game Matchups Locks:  These games feature Defenses that should be overmatched against the Offense. Carolina's Richard Huntley / Nick Goings / Fred Hoover vs New York Jets Defense Who didn't see an injury coming for Biakabutuka?   Or Terry Glenn?   Or Fred Taylor?   I know there are lots of arguments out there that the ""injury prone"" tag is unjustified for some players but in my opinion, you shouldn't be surprised to see guys like Biakabutuka go down.   Coach George Seifert has said he's giving Huntley the ""Golden Opportunity"" as the starting RB this week.   Let's see what he can do with it.   Can't think of a better defense to run on than the pathetic Jets.   New York ranks # 31 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks giving up a whopping 186 rushing yards a game.   They rank # 30 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs. Don't underestimate the loss of OL Kevin Donnalley though.   He was a valuable part of the line.   One other semi troubling fact is that Brad Hoover had 2 Red Zone rushes last week.   Still though, if there was ever a week to start Huntley, this is it. Dallas' Emmitt Smith vs Arizona Defense It's hard to get too excited about Emmitt Smith these days but this is a good matchup for him.   The Cowboys have had a week off and they'll be facing the soft Arizona defense ranked # 26 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks.   They're # 28 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs. QB Anthony Wright has another week of practice under the belt and should be able to provide some passing threat to open the running game.   At least that's the theory.   You've got to pick your spots with Smith and this looks like a pretty good one if you've been considering playing him. Indianapolis' Edgerrin James vs Kansas City Defense Start James.   Yes, he's in a slump ranking just # 12 in Fantasy Points over the last 3 games but you have to start him.  Especially against the Kansas City defense that ranks # 29 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks.   If you doubt a guy like James, remember he had 7 Red Zone rushes last week.   That's more than a lot of backs have for the season.   He's getting the opportunities. Kansas City's Priest Holmes / Tony Richardson vs Indianapolis Defense Priest Holmes had another solid game last week against the soft Arizona defense rushing for 85 yards on 15 carries (5.7 ypc)   This week, he'll face an equally bad Colt defense that ranks # 23 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks.   They rank # 29 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.   DE Chad Bratzke is doubtful and that'll help Holmes.   For now, it looks like Tony Richardson is being eased back into the mix.   Look to see what kind of role he'll take on there but for this week, I think it'll be primarily Holmes again. New York's Tiki Barber / Ron Dayne vs Washington Defense The Giants Duo was less than impressive running the ball Monday night against Philadelphia.  But the Redskins rush defense is a different story. Washington ranks # 30 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks.   They rank # 31 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.   I'd expect a similar distribution in carries as we saw Monday night (Barber - 13 , Dayne - 16) and I'd expect both of them to have solid games against this horrible defense.   Dayne is clearly the Red Zone rusher though.   He had 4 attempts Monday vs just 1 Rushing attempt for Barber.  (Barber did have 2 passes thrown to him in the Red Zone) New York Jet's Curtis Martin vs Carolina Defense Curtis Martin ran well when he ran last week.   It's just that he didn't get to run enough.   Martin totaled 63 yards on 14 carries (4.5) but he needs more than 14 carries.   He'll get them this week against a Carolina defense that ranks # 22 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks. Carolina was already thin at LB but with Hannibal Navies breaking his arm last week, it's even worse now.   This could be a big day for Martin. San Diego's LaDainian Tomlinson vs Buffalo Defense Tomlinson is very good.   The Bills are not.   Buffalo ranks # 27 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks.   They rank # 27 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.   If you can afford to bench Tomlinson, you probably don't need any more help from here. /**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/ Prime Matchups:  These games feature Defenses that should have trouble stopping the Offense. Baltimore's Terry Allen / Jason Brookins vs Jacksonville Defense Keep an eye on the injury reports here as Terry Allen suffered a sprained ankle last week and is iffy for Sunday's game.   Jason Brookins filled in pretty nicely for Allen rushing 13 times for 46 yards (3.5 ypc).   He did have a fumble though.   Jacksonville's struggling and they're not getting a lot of help from their defense.   They rank # 20 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks.   They're only slightly better in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs ranking # 16.   There were lots of rumors floating around about the Ravens trying to trade for a RB.   They apparently don't feel Allen / Brookins are enough to get the job done.   Keep an eye on this through the week to see if Allen can go.   If you have to submit your lineups by Thursday, I'd be leery of either back though. Cincinnati's Corey Dillon vs Detroit Defense The knock on Corey Dillon has always been his inconsistency.   He did little to quiet the critics Sunday with a 16 carry for 30 yard (1.9 ypc) day against the Bears.   Although you have to give the Bears defense credit - they're tough.  This week, he faces a much softer Lions unit that ranks # 16 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks.   They're # 21 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.   I'm willing to discount last week's performance as a testament to the Bears.   Dillon simply didn't matchup well with the tough inside defenders of Chicago and I expect him to fare much better here. Denver's Mike Shanahan vs New England Defense Take your pick here.  The latest Terrell Davis news from Sports Illustrated is that he may be injured more than anyone's letting on.   And now ESPN's John Clayton is reporting that Olandis Gary may get the start over Mike Anderson in an effort to shake up the offense.   Sheesh.  The Broncos are struggling offensively to get much going.   They'll face a Patriot team on a major roll.   Although statistically, they're still giving up a ton of yards.   The Indy / New England box score from last week was a strange one - Indy loses 38-17 but has 484 total yards including 179 rushing.   The Patriots rank # 25 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks and also rank # 25 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.   When Anderson ran last week, he did pretty well gaining 50 yards on 11 carries (4.5 ypc) although he did have a fumble.   11 carries won't get it done for you though.   If I had to turn in a roster Thursday, I'd probably shy away from the whole situation if I could even though I'd expect the Broncos as a team to run well on New England. Detroit's James Stewart / Lamont Warren vs Cincinnati Defense Keep an eye on this one as James Stewart suffered an ankle injury and his status is uncertain for this week's game.   Lamont Warren will go if Stewart can't.   Neither player did a lot against Tennessee last week.   Warren had 18 yards on 6 carries (3.0 ypc)   Stewart had 17 yards on 9 carries (1.9 ypc)   The Bengal defense is enticing though as they rank just # 28 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks.   They rank # 22 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.   It's likely a decision on who'll play may not come till later this week so understand this is a risky call here if you must decide now. Pittsburgh's Jerome Bettis vs Tennessee Defense How can you not start Jerome Bettis?   He ranks # 6 over the last 3 weeks in Fantasy Points among RBs.   The Titans are improving their rush defense and now rank # 10 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks. For the year though, they rank # 26 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs. Bettis is on a roll and I wouldn't want to be in his way come Monday Night at their new stadium. /**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/ Even Matchups:  These games feature no real advantage either way Arizona's Michael Pittman vs Dallas Defense Michael Pittman continues to run well and that shouldn't change against Dallas.   Don't forget about his receiving as he's rolled up 311 total yards over the last 3 weeks.   Dallas is pretty average on defense ranking # 15 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks.   They rank # 14 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.  Thomas Jones did get 7 carries (and a TD) last week but I think it'll be primarily Pittman here. Minnesota's Doug Chapman vs Tampa Bay Defense Against a very good Packer Defense last week, Chapman rushed for 90 yards on 22 carries (4.1 ypc).   This week, he faces Tampa Bay which has fallen all the way to # 21 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks. They're tougher in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs where they rank # 12 for the year.   Pittsburgh rolled up 220 rushing yards against Tampa Sunday so they can definitely be run on.   One note of concern is that Jimmy Kleinsasser had 3 Red Zone rushing attempts last week compared to just 1 for Chapman.   Chapman showed a great nose for the endzone in college so let's hope that Red Zone distribution starts to change.   Tampa has the tough reputation but I wouldn't be afraid of this matchup at all. New Orleans' Ricky Williams vs St. Louis Defense Over the last 3 weeks, Ricky Williams is the # 4 RB in Fantasy Points.   He starts this week for me regardless of the matchup.   St. Louis ranks # 11 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks.   They rank # 17 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.   Certainly, the high powered Ram offense can take a RB out of the game but the numbers show that teams have had some success running on them.   I'll take my chances with Ricky. Oakland's Charlie Garner vs Philadelphia Defense Tyrone Wheatley could play this week but I'm doubting it.   I think it'll be Charlie Garner trying to carry the load.   The Eagles have the tough reputation but they rank just # 19 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks and # 18 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.   Part of that is due to their very tough pass defense.   Oakland's coming off a bye week while Philadelphia's coming off a short week following a Monday night game.   Don't forget the team's ties here.   Jon Gruden and Charlie Garner are both former Eagles.   Bottom line - I like Gruden's ability to be able to create some situations for Garner to shine. Seattle's Shaun Alexander vs Miami Defense The Miami defense has lost some luster ranking # 14 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks.   They're still tough though and having a healthy Zach Thomas will be a big plus.   Thomas is mobile and a hard hitter.   Alexander is the top ranked RB in the league over the last 3 weeks with 4 TDs in his 2 games.   Not sure he can keep that pace but you almost have to start him this week. St. Louis' Trung Canidate / Marshall Faulk vs New Orleans Defense At this point, it looks like Faulk may sit another week and Canidate gets the start again.   Coach Mike Martz is claiming he wants Faulk to be ""100%"" before returning.   Canidate's stellar play allows him that luxury. Although Canidate won't be surprising anyone after the huge game last week. And he doesn't get to play the Swiss Cheese Jets again.   New Orleans is tough defense ranked # 7 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks but I'd still roll the dice on Canidate if you're needing a home run.   He's got that breakaway potential to score from anywhere.   He also had 6 Red Zone rushing attempts which should put to rest any talk that he's not big enough to handle the goalline carries. Tampa Bay's Warrick Dunn / Mike Alstott vs Minnesota Defense Warrick Dunn says the injured foot / toe will bother him for a while but now he's got a hamstring injury to worry about.   He hopes to be able to go this weekend although he was ineffective last week against Pittsburgh rushing for 31 yards on 13 carries (2.4 ypc)   That won't cut it.   The Minnesota defense is nothing special ranking # 17 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks.   They come in at # 13 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.   Both the Tampa Bay WRs, Keyshawn Johnson and Jacquez Green are less than 100% for this game (and may even be unavailable - stay tuned) so the Bucs may be forced to run the ball.   The Bucs haven't been scaring many people through the air as it was and this will let the defense stack against the run even more. /**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/ Downside Matchups:  These games feature a Defense that could pose trouble for the Offense. Chicago's Anthony Thomas / James Allen vs San Francisco Defense Coach Dick Jauron said Tuesday he ""doesn't want to be a one back team"" and that even after Thomas' incredible performance Sunday, Chicago will still use a RB tandem.   He said they'll be ""going with the hot hand"".   It's my guess you'll see Thomas have the hotter hand again this week.   Last week, he rolled for 188 yards on 22 carries (8.5 ypc) and a TD.   He should have had another TD as well getting tackled at the 1 after a 46 yard run.   San Francisco is tough against the run ranking # 6 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks.   Although they're just # 19 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.   I like Thomas here but be leery that Dick Jauron is saying James Allen will still see time.   It's important to note that last week was the first week that James Allen did not get a Red Zone opportunity.   And it was the first week that Anthony Thomas did get one.   The writing is on the wall and it's my opinion that Jauron is trying to smooth feathers and keep Allen positive. Miami's Lamar Smith vs Seattle Defense This could be a tough game for Lamar Smith.   He's a between the tackles runner and the Seahawks may give him trouble.  DTs Chad Eaton and John Randle are a solid pair and MLB Levon Kirkland is tough.   Seattle ranks # 6 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks.   They also rank # 6 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.   Travis Minor could see more action as the Dolphins like his receiving abilities.   Smith is still a solid player but I'm not excited about this matchup. New England's Antowain Smith vs Denver Defense Antowain Smith rushed for 71 yards on 21 carries (3.4 ypc) against a weak Colt defense Sunday.   Denver is much tougher ranking # 13 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks.   They're # 11 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.   The Patriots are all about QB Tom Brady right now and I'd expect him to stay the focus.   Smith will run just enough to keep the defense semi-honest.   A decent matchup but certainly no cakewalk. Philadelphia's Correll Buckhalter /  Duce Staley vs Oakland Defense Tough to say for certain which back gets the bulk of the work but I think you'll still see Buckhalter carry most of the load.   At least until Staley shows he's back and 100%.   Staley had just 3 carries Monday night but should start slowly working his way back into game shape.   It won't be easy against a tough Raider Defense ranked # 9 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks. Tennessee's Eddie George vs Pittsburgh Defense George had been struggling.   Over the last 3 weeks, he's the 26th ranked RB.   Not what you'd expect out of him.   The task doesn't get any easier this week against a very tough and aggressive Pittsburgh Defense that ranks # 8 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks.   They rank # 9 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.   George is a power rushing RB who doesn't match up very well with the Pittsburgh defense that's built to stop the power game. /**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/ Defensive Slam Dunks:  These games feature a very tough Defense posing major problems for the Offense. Buffalo's Travis Henry vs San Diego Defense Henry is running hard but he's struggling to produce numbers worthy of your starting lineup.   The Offensive Line just isn't creating much for him to work with.   And he's not an ultra quick guy who can make something out of nothing.   Henry's best bulldozing through a hole that's opened and punishing tacklers but he's had little chance to do that.   I don't see this changing much against a tough San Diego defense ranked # 4 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks.   They rank # 3 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.   All Pro Linebacker Junior Seau is iffy for this game and that will certainly help Henry if Seau can't go.   Although I still don't like this matchup. Jacksonville's Stacey Mack vs Baltimore Defense Fred Taylor misses another game.   Like that's news.   Stacy Mack is no Fred Taylor and unfortunately, they'll be facing a Baltimore defense that's as tough as ever, despite their record.   The Ravens rank # 1 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks.   They also rank # 1 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.   Avoid Mack unless you're in a real pinch.  On the subject of Taylor, I'm getting a lot of email and I honestly am not hearing any more than you apparently are (or aren't)   Jacksonville is keeping it close to the vest.   They're saying it's possible he'll play next week but that's just a guess at this point.   The injury appears to be very serious and it's not looking too good.   Not a lot you can do at this point though if you're a Taylor owner as his trade value's already hit rock bottom. Hang on and hope for the best. San Francisco's Garrison Hearst / Kevan Barlow vs Chicago Defense Chicago continues to rise up the defensive charts with a stifling run defense.   Last week, they held Corey Dillon down.   Over the last 4 weeks, they rank # 3 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game.   DTs Keith Traylor and Ted Washington do a great job of clogging up the middle while MLB Brian Urlacher is a proven run stopper.   The advantage for Hearst and Barlow over Dillon is that they run outside more often but still, a very touch matchup. Washington's Stephen Davis New York Giants Defense Davis can't seem to find the endzone but he continues to run hard and pile up some yards.   Over the last 3 weeks, he's gathered 257 total yards which is solid.   This looks like a tough week for him though as the Giants rank # 2 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks.   They rank # 4 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.   Davis is the kind of guy who'll likely go off when you least expect it but this doesn't look like a good matchup to me. /**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/ That'll do it for the Rushing Matchups.

bryant@cheatsheets.net,0,0,0.902,133b17ea-dc7c-48b9-b6fb-ab6240149fb9,"body: Hi Folks, Here's how I see the Passing Game Matchups this week. PLEASE NOTE:   See the cheatsheet online www.footballguys.com for exactly where I rank players and to determine who to start.   I always receive emails asking me how I can have a guy ranked highly on the cheatsheet but listed under a matchup that favors the Defense.   Just because one matchup may be more favorable than another, that doesn't necessarily mean I'd start the player with the best matchup.   Peyton Manning may have a horrible matchup one week but unless you're sitting on Kurt Warner or Daunte Culpepper, Manning's your guy no matter who he's lining up against.   The matchup info is meant to be just one more tool in your box when it comes to deciding between players. Note:  I've used the player stats sorted by performance over the last four weeks extensively in developing these write-ups. Stats are provided by Mike Hall's excellent FLM League Management Software.  http://www.fflm.com/ for more info. Let's get to it. Joe /**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/ Passing Game Matchups to Avoid and Exploit Locks:  These games feature Defenses that should be overmatched against the Offense. Chicago's Passing Game vs San Francisco Defense QB Jim Miller isn't flashy, but he gets it done.   Losing WR Marcus Robinson was a huge blow though and they'll be hard pressed to pick up the slack. Rookie David Terrell will see increased time as will Dez White.   Marty Booker is the other WR and he should be solid.   Of the bunch, Terrell has the most talent but is by far the least experienced.   Look for him to grow up in a hurry.   San Francisco can definitely be thrown on as shown by their # 26 ranking in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks. They rank # 22 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs.   The Bears will likely try to flex their new found rushing game muscle but I think it'll come down to how well they can cover the loss of Marcus Robinson.   It's a good matchup, I'm just not sure if the Bears can take advantage of it. Denver Passing Game vs New England Defense Brian Griese tries to rally his team against the suddenly dangerous Patriots.   New England ranks # 22 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   That may be just what the Broncos need.   Eddie Kennison is playing better and Rod Smith is facing double and triple teams, yet still producing.   Ty Law is a solid Cornerback but Otis Smith on the other side is vulnerable.   Griese's shoulder is sore but he'll play through it.   It looks like it may be an issue all season. Minnesota Passing Game vs Tampa Bay Defense Daunte Culpepper didn't put up the eye popping stats last week but the Vikings won a tough game against the Packers.   You could see a similar performance this week in this important game against Tampa Bay.   The Bucs rank # 24 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks so they've obviously been thrown on.   Randy Moss and Cris Carter are solid plays as is Culpepper.   I also like TE Byron Chamberlain to make some noise here. /**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/ Prime Matchups:  These games feature Defenses that should have trouble stopping the Offense. Baltimore Passing Game vs Jacksonville Defense Here's all you need to know about the Jaguar Pass Defense:  Rob Johnson looked pretty good against them last week and was only sacked 2 times. That says a lot.  The Jags rank # 18 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks but they seem to be regressing.   Elvis Grbac is listed as Questionable with a rib / chest injury and is no lock to start.   Randall Cunningham would go if Grbac can't.   After getting everyone's expectations up, WR Travis Taylor disappeared last week having only 1 pass thrown his way.   Brandon Stokely had 9 and Qadry Ismail had 10.   So it's tough to say how it'll play this week.   I really like Taylor, but he sure came up small last week.   Shannon Sharpe is a good play like always and rookie TE Todd Heap should hopefully see action this week. Carolina Passing Game vs New York Jets Defense QB Chris Weinke seems to be regressing a bit after a very solid start.   His interceptions last week were killers.   He faces a Jets team that ranks # 21 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks so he could get back on track.  They rank # 20 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs.   Muhsin Muhammad and Donald Hayes will face solid corners Aaron Glenn and Marcus Coleman.   The real damage for Carolina can be done with TE Wesley Walls who's always a factor. Cincinnati Passing Game vs Detroit Defense New Flash - Jon Kitna must be more consistent.   For better or worse, the Bengals record seems to mirror his play.   Losing WR Chad Johnson hurt as Johnson brought a true deep threat to the table - something the other WRs do not.   Darnay Scott and Peter Warrick are limited by Kitna's play and don't seem to be as active as they were earlier.   The Lions rank # 27 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks so they can definitely be thrown on.   For the year, Detroit ranks # 30 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs so maybe there is hope for Kitna this week. Kansas City Passing Game vs Indianapolis Defense QB Trent Green should get a break Thursday night against a Colt defense that hasn't put much pressure on the QB (4 sacks in the last 3 games).   They rank # 16 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   DE Chad Bratzke is Questionable so that should help even more.   WR Derrick Alexander is getting back in the groove of things with a 4 reception day for 99 yards and a TD last week.   Chris Thomas will likely start but Snoop Minnis will see time too.   New England abused Cornerback David Macklin last week and the Chiefs should have similar results.   The Colts rank # 28 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.   As always, TE Tony Gonzalez will be a huge part of the game New York Giants Passing Game vs Washington Defense The big buzz this week is that Coach Jim Fassell is rumored to be considering not starting WR Amani Toomer.   Remember, last year, Toomer was briefly demoted and he responded with a great finish.   Even if this happens, I don't expect it to be a big deal as Toomer is clearly the Giants best option at WR.   QB Kerry Collins struggled with just 162 yards last week against the Eagles but Philadelphia is on a different level.   The Redskins are ranked just # 23 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks and the Giants should get back on track. New York Jets Passing Game vs Carolina Defense The Jet passing game will be without WR Wayne Chrebet this week as he recovers from a concussion.   Kevin Swayne will likely get the start in his place and I think you'll see a lot more of Matthew Hatchette too. Testeverde's been ok but not great.   This offense is all about Curtis Martin though and I don't see that changing.   Although the passing matchup is enticing as the Panthers rank just # 30 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   The Carolina Linebacking Corps is in shambles so TE Anthony Becht might be a good play.   The Panthers rank # 28 in Fantasy Points Allowed to TEs. St. Louis Passing Game vs New Orleans Defense Start your Rams.   Yes, New Orleans is solid but each one of these St. Louis players is capable of winning your game for you this week.   Kurt Warner, Torry Holt, and Issac Bruce are must starts with Az-Zahir Hakim a likely starter for many teams. Tampa Bay Passing Game vs Minnesota Defense Injuries are taking their toll on the Buccaneer WRs.   Both Keyshawn Johnson (hip flexor) and Jacquez Green (groin) are Questionable for this week.  That doesn't bode well for them or for QB Brad Johnson.   Minnesota ranks # 25 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks so the opportunity is there if they can get healthy.   But right now, it's a tough call until you know more.   I'd expect both to play but you don't know for sure.   If the WRs are limited, that'll obviously drag Brad Johnson's numbers down. /**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/ Even Matchups:  These games feature no real advantage either way Detroit Passing Game vs Cincinnati Defense I've never been a Charlie Batch fan but he's making a believer out of me. He blew up against the Titans Sunday with a 338 / 3 TD / 1 Interception day. The Bengal Defense has put up good numbers ranking # 6 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   On the flip side to that, Rodney Heath and Robert Bean are out, so the secondary could be ripe for Batch this week.   Lions WRs Germane Crowell and Herman Moore are gone but Johnnie Morton is ready to go.   Larry Foster will be the # 2 WR and don't count him out.   Morton can't catch every pass.   Morton has been averaging 8 targets per game but that'll surely rise.   Detroit just signed WR Bert Emanuel so all their troubles are now over... New England Passing Game vs Denver Defense Count me on the Tom Brady Bandwagon.   He's done well against several different defenses both at home and on the road.   He plays a very similar game to fellow Michigan grad Brian Griese - He doesn't dazzle you with physicals but he plays a solid, heady game.   Don't know for sure, but it wouldn't surprise me if his Dad were a coach.   He has that kind of game. Chris Mortensen reported earlier this week that Drew Bledsoe may not be coming back this season because of his injury.   Terry Glenn is a question mark for this week.  His agent is crying again that mean old Bill Belichick made him hurt his hamstring.   I'm so far over that.   If he plays, he could produce.   Troy Brown will also see a ton of looks and you can't count out Mr. Do Everything, David Patten.   Denver ranks # 24 in Fantasy Points Allowed to TEs so I wouldn't be surprised to see Jermaine Wiggins make some noise. New Orleans Passing Game vs St. Louis Defense Like everyone else, I'm a little worried about Aaron Brooks.   He ranks just # 17 among QBs in Fantasy Points over the last 3 weeks.   Things won't get any easier this week against a vastly improved Ram defense that ranks # 13 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   The focus of the Saints is (rightly) RB Ricky Williams and Brooks simply isn't being counted on to carry the team.   WRs Joe Horn and Willie Jackson are garnering most of the passes with Albert Connell getting a few looks.   TE Cam Cleeland is doing his Bubba Franks impression scoring on just about every pass he catches.   The Rams rank # 17 in Fantasy Points Allowed to TEs so Cleeland might do some damage. Philadelphia Passing Game vs Oakland Defense Donovan McNabb threw just enough to win Sunday afternoon.   He'll likely do the same against an Oakland defense that's ranked # 20 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   Cornerback Charles Woodson's a shutdown corner and is as good as anyone in the game.   WR Todd Pinkston's wrist wasn't supposed to be any big deal but he's showing up on the injury report as Questionable.   Coach Andy Reid said he thought he'd be good to for Sunday.   If Woodson lines up on James Thrash, Pinkston could produce. San Diego Passing Game vs Buffalo Defense Buffalo at San Diego...Think they'll be any revenge factor brewing here? Just a little I'm guessing.   QB Doug Flutie takes his team against a Buffalo Defense that's actually been very solid against the pass ranking # 1 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   Much of that can be attributed to games against Pittsburgh, Jacksonville, and the Jets. Still though, they're decent defending the pass and will give Flutie some obstacles.   Jeff Graham is clearly the most active WR while they're doing what they can to get TE Freddie Jones into the game. San Francisco Passing Game vs Chicago Defense QB Jeff Garcia's picked up where he left off last year.   Over the last 3 weeks, he's the # 1 rated QB in the league in Fantasy Points.   His 3 rushing TDs lead the team.   They'll face a stout defense in Chicago that's better suited for stopping the run than the pass.   The Bears rank # 19 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   MLB Brian Urlacher is very tough on the mid range routes but look for the 49ers to exploit the Chicago Corners, R.W. McQuarters and Walt Harris.   No corner matches up well with Terrell Owens and this week won't be any different. J.J. Stokes and Tai Streets will see action as well but make no mistake, this team is about Garcia throwing to Owens. Washington Passing Game vs New York Giants Defense Tony Banks to Rod Gardner.   What a great performance by the rookie WR last week.   It'll be tougher to repeat as the Giants are much more physical. They rank # 12 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks. Gardner has seen 7+ passes thrown his way each game since week 3.   Michael Westbrook's numbers have been falling.   Pretty tough matchup for the young Gardner. /**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/ Downside Matchups:  These games feature a Defense that could pose trouble for the Offense. Arizona Passing Game vs Dallas Defense The Arizona passing game is all about David Boston.   And rightfully so. Cowboy Cornerbacks Mario Edwards and Duane Hawthorne can't matchup with Boston and the Cardinal running game with Michael Pittman will have the safeties creeping forward.   On the flip side, Dallas ranks # 5 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks and it's hard to argue with the numbers.   Obviously, they're stopping teams somehow.   Jake Plummer should have time to throw as the Cowboys have only registered 5 sacks in the last 3 games. Buffalo Passing Game vs San Diego Defense Is there a light at the end of the tunnel for Rob Johnson?   He did play much better last week.   Before I get too excited, he's got a tough matchup this week with San Diego who plays pretty decent pass defense.   Plus, you know the Chargers will be pumped up playing the Bills with all the ties there.   The Chargers rank # 14 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   WR Eric Moulds, TE Jay Reimersma, and FB Larry Centers will see the bulk of the passes from Johnson.   In an effort to save Rob Johnson's life, I think you'll continue to see the coaching staff rely heavily on the short passes to Reimersma and Centers. Dallas Passing Game vs Arizona Defense With Anthony Wright's knee troubles, looks like Dallas will start Clint Stoerner or Ryan Leaf.   Ouch.   Although to be fair, I've always been a guy who felt Leaf still has a chance in this league.   Call me crazy, I know. WR Joey Galloway is questionable with a bad foot so that's a negative.   If Wright's unable to go, I'd probably shy away from all these guys until you see them perform. Indianapolis Passing Game vs Kansas City Defense If you own any Colt players, you've seen first hand the differences between real and Fantasy Football lately.   Marvin Harrison, Peyton Manning and Edgerrin James turned in great Fantasy performances last week - en route to the Colts getting spanked by the Patriots.   Go figure.   They'll have a pretty tough matchup this week against Kansas City who ranks # 2 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.    Much of that ranking comes from the fact KC is so easy to run on.   Corners William Bartee and Eric Warfield will have their hands full with Harrison and Rookie Reggie Wayne.  Looks like WR Jerome Pathon will miss another game with a sprained foot.   Look for the Colts to take what the Chiefs give them - running room for James. Jacksonville Passing Game vs Baltimore Defense Over the last two weeks, it's become very clear that the way to attack the Ravens defense is to spread the field with multiple WR sets.   Look for Jacksonville to do just that and for QB Mark Brunell to possibly focus a bit more on the shorter passing game.   WRs Jimmy Smith and Keenan McCardell are both solid players.   They'll face a Raven defense that's ranked # 11 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   They're much more effective in stopping the run than they are the pass.   With Stacey Mack rushing the ball, the Jags would just as well throw.   TE Kyle Brady might be worth a shot as Baltimore ranks # 26 in Fantasy Points Allowed to TEs. Miami Passing Game vs Seattle Defense Jay Fiedler faces an improving Seattle defense that's ranked # 17 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   Miami's had a week off to prepare.   WRs Oronde Gadsden and our Footballguy favorite Chris Chambers will see most of the passes although Cornerback Shawn Springs is getting back to form after his hamstring injury and will likely limit Gadsden's play. Pittsburgh Passing Game vs Tennessee Defense The Steelers are rolling but don't think Kordell Stewart has too much to do with it.   I'd avoid pretty much everyone on this offense outside of Jerome Bettis and Kris Brown.   If you really have to reach, WR Plaxico Burress is seeing lots of balls thrown his way and actually has more targets the last two weeks than Hines Ward.   Burress should be able to use his size to his advantage in the Red Zone.   Injured Cornerback Samari Rolle says he has a 50-50 chance of playing Monday.   But bottom line is this team is all about Jerome Bettis and Defense. /**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/ Defensive Slam Dunks:  These games feature a very tough Defense posing major problems for the Offense. Oakland Passing Game vs Philadelphia Defense QB Rich Gannon and his Hall of Famers, Jerry Rice and Tim Brown will take on one of the most aggressive pass defenses in the game.   Against Oakland's savvy veterans, I'm not certain unlimited blitzing is the best course of action.   Brown and Rice are guys who can find the open seam and fortunately, Gannon's a guy who can deliver the ball.   The Eagles rank # 3 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks though so something's gotta give. Seattle Passing Game vs Miami Defense In one of the more controversial moves of the season, Coach Mike Holmgren has awarded Matt Hasselbeck his job back.   Trent Dilfer goes back to the bench.   While he's there, he'll likely see Hasselbeck struggle against a tough Miami Defense.   Miami ranks # 8 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks and Cornerbacks Patrick Surtain and Sam Madison are as good as any pair in the game. Tennessee Passing Game vs Pittsburgh Defense Steve McNair looked almost like a real live NFL QB last week.   Although he still can't get the ball past his TE as Frank Wycheck rolled for 100 yards. Look for more of the same this week as the Steelers create trouble. Pittsburgh is ranked # 4 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   Their aggressive Linebacker play could create some opportunities for Wycheck and Erron Kinney to find some seams in the middle. As usual, the TEs are the best options here. /**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/ Bryant Analytics, Inc.

denver.plachy@enron.com,0,0,0.903,0757ede4-5a49-4a0f-9eb8-2a50583dc217,"body: Less than a year ago, the Houston-based energy behemoth had everything: money, power, glitz, smarts, new ideas, and a CEO who wanted to make it the most important company in the world. Now its stock is down, wall street is bearish, and the CEO is gone. What went wrong? by Mimi Swartz </mag/issues/authors/mimiswartz.php> THE ENRON SKYSCRAPER NEAR THE SOUTH END OF HOUSTON'S DOWNTOWN feels like the international headquarters of the best and the brightest. The lobby in no way resembles the hushed, understated entryways of the old-fashioned oil companies, like Shell and Texaco nearby. Enron, in contrast, throbs with modernity. The people hustling in and out of the elevators are black, white, brown; Asian, Middle Eastern, European, African, as well as American-born. They are young, mostly under 35, and dressed in the aggressively casual uniform of the tech industry-the guys wear khakis, polo shirts, and Banana Republic button-downs. Almost preposterously fit, they move through the building intently, like winners. Enron is nothing if not energetic: A Big Brother-size TV screen frantically reports on the stock market near a bank of elevators, while another hefty black television relaying the same news greets people entering from the garage. A sculpture of the corporate symbol, an E tipped at a jaunty angle, radiates colors as it spins frenetically on its axis; a Starbucks concession on the ground floor keeps everyone properly caffeinated. Multicolored, inspirational flags hang from the ceiling, congratulating Enron on its diversity and its values; one more giant banner between elevator banks declares Enron's simple if grandiose goal: ""From the World's Leading Energy Company to . . . The World's Leading Company!"" For a while, that future seemed guaranteed, as Enron transformed itself from a stodgy, troubled pipeline company in 1985 to a trading colossus in 2000. It was a Wall Street darling, with a stock price that increased 1,700 percent in that sixteen-year period, with revenues that increased from $40 billion to $100 billion. ""The very mention of the company in energy circles throughout the world creates reactions ranging from paralyzing fear to envy,"" notes a 2001 report from Global Change Associates, a firm that provides market intelligence to the energy business. This Enron was largely the creation of Jeff Skilling, a visionary determined to transform American business. Hired sixteen years ago as a consultant by then-CEO Ken Lay, Skilling helped build a company that disdained the old formula of finding energy in the ground, hauling it in pipelines, and then selling it to refineries and other customers. Instead, it evolved into a company that could trade and market energy in all its forms, from natural gas to electricity, from wind to water. If you had a risky drilling venture, Enron would fund it for a piece of the action. If you wanted your megacorporation's energy needs analyzed and streamlined, Enron could do the job. If you were a Third World country with a pitiful infrastructure and burgeoning power needs, Enron was there to build and build. Basically, if an idea was new and potentially-and fantastically-lucrative, Enron wanted the first crack. And with each success, Enron became ever more certain of its destiny. The company would be the bridge between the old economy and the high-tech world, and in February of this year, Skilling reaped his reward when he succeeded Lay as chief executive officer. Enron, says Skilling, ""was a great marriage of the risk-taking mentality of the oil patch with the risk-taking mentality of the financial markets."" The Enron story reflects the culture that drove American business at the end of the twentieth century. Like the high-tech companies it emulated, Enron was going to reinvent the American business model and, in turn, the American economy. Maybe it was natural that this Brave New World also produced a culture that was based on absolutes: not just the old versus the new, but the best versus the mediocre, the risk takers versus the complacent-those who could see the future versus those who could not. The key was investing in the right kind of intellectual capital. With the best and the brightest, a company couldn't possibly go wrong. Or could it? Today Enron's stock trades at around $35, down from a high of $80 in January. The press cast Enron as the archvillain of California's energy crisis last spring, and Skilling caught a blueberry pie in the face for his relentless defense of the free market. A long-troubled power plant project in India threatened the company's global ambitions. Telecommunications, in which Enron was heavily invested, imploded. Wall Street analysts who once touted the company questioned its accounting practices. Some of the change in Enron's fortunes can be attributed to the economic downturn in uncertain times that has afflicted all of American business. But the culture that the company created and lived by cannot escape blame. ENRON, JEFF SKILLING SAYS, HAD ""a totally different way of thinking about business-we got it."" At Enron, in fact, you either ""got it"" or you were gone-it was as simple as black and white. It is not coincidental, then, that the color scheme of Skilling's River Oaks mansion mirrors the corporation he once headed. Here, the living room's white walls shimmer against the mahogany floors. Black leather trims the edge of snowy carpets. Billowy sofas set off the jet-black baby grand. In the entry, white orchids cascade from a black vase on a black pedestal table that in turn pools onto cold, white marble. There is only one off-color note: After almost twenty years, Jeff Skilling is no longer associated with Enron, having resigned abruptly after just six months as CEO. Once, Skilling was hailed as the next Jack Welch (General Electric's masterful CEO), as one of Worth magazine's best CEO's in America (anointed in 2001), and even as a daredevil who hosted the kind of unchained adventure junkets in which, a friend told BusinessWeek, ""someone could actually get killed."" Today, he sounds more like Ebenezer Scrooge on Christmas morning. ""I had no idea what I'd let go of,"" Skilling says of all the personal sacrifices he made while retooling Enron.  From a black chair in the white library, across from a huge black and white photograph of his daughter and two sons, Skilling clarifies. The demands of working 24-7 for Enron caused him to ignore his personal finances. Divorced, he lived in a 2,200-square-foot house without a microwave or a dishwasher. He almost missed his brother's wedding. ""Learning a foreign language-I never learned a foreign language!"" he exclaims. He never once took his youngest son to school. ""I'm interested in the kids. You don't do kids in fifteen-minute scheduling."" Travel: ""You can't go to Africa for a week and get anything out of it!"" Skilling includes the study of architecture and design on his list of missed opportunities, then he stops and sighs. ""I'm not sure that fulfillment in life is compatible with a CEO's job,"" he says, finally. Then his eyes lock on mine, and his voice, which had softened, regains its pragmatic edge. ""It would have been easy to stay,"" he says. ""But that would not have been good for me.""  He's a smallish, ruddy-faced man who keeps himself at fighting weight, handsome in the way of corporate titans, with piercing cheekbones and that assiduously stolid gaze. But the impatience Skilling once reserved for cautious underlings and dull-witted utility company executives is now targeted at reporters who have labeled his resignation ""bizarre"" and associates who are bitterly skeptical of his need for family time. His shrug stretches the limits of his shimmering blue button-down, and his matching blue eyes look put upon. ""I'm surprised,"" he says, ""that people have so much trouble understanding this."" PEOPLE WHO PASSED THROUGH DOWNTOWN HOUSTON in the late eighties or early nineties couldn't help but notice a funny and, for its time, novel scene unfolding throughout the workday at the base of the Enron Building. From nine to five and before and after, you could see people slipping out of the pristine silver skyscraper to smoke. They perched on the chrome banisters or lurked near the glass doors at the entry, puffing like mad. They always looked hurried and furtive, even ashamed. Whatever people knew about Enron in those days (and most people didn't know much), it was often associated with that scene: Enron boasted one of the first nonsmoking corporate headquarters in Houston, and there couldn't have been clearer evidence of its break with the energy world of the past. What macho engineer would have put up with such humiliation? But this company was a child of another time, that period in the mid-eighties when chaos enveloped the gas business. Federal deregulation of natural gas turned a steady, secure industry, in which gas pipeline companies frequently enjoyed a monopoly in portions of the areas that they served, into a volatile free-for-all. The situation was compounded five years later by federal deregulation of the pipeline business. So it happened that a gentlemanly gas pipeline company, Houston Natural Gas (HNG) found itself under attack from Coastal Corporation, Oscar Wyatt's less than gentlemanly firm. HNG was then run by Lay, a sturdy, taciturn former economics professor and Transco chief operating officer who had a passion for military strategy. (His doctoral thesis at the University of Houston was on supply and demand in the Vietnam War.) Lay, who was from Missouri and never succumbed-at least outwardly-to Texas brashness, had done well enough: Thanks to canny expansions, HNG's pipelines stretched from Florida to California and throughout the state of Texas. HNG fended off Coastal, but to protect the company from other takeover attempts, Lay nimbly engineered the sale of HNG in 1985 to a friendly Nebraska pipeline concern called InterNorth, one of the largest pipeline companies in the country at the time. Then, a funny thing happened: HNG started acting in a way that would characterize the company for years to come-a lot like Coastal. What the Nebraskans blithely labeled ""the purchase"" was being called ""the merger"" back in Houston, and before long, following some particularly brutal politicking between Omaha and Houston, the company's center of gravity started shifting toward Texas, and shortly after that, Ken Lay was running a new company called Enron. ""Over time it became clear that Lay had a better vision of the future,"" says one person associated with Enron at that time. ""He never fought change. He embraced change."" Lay had won, but what exactly did that mean? Enron was saddled with massive debt from the takeover attempt, and thanks to deregulation, no longer had exclusive use of its pipelines. Without new ideas-for that matter, a whole new business plan-the company could be finished before it really even got started.  LIKE MANY PEOPLE WHO TEAMED UP WITH ENRON IN THE EIGHTIES, Jeff Skilling had spent a lot of time in the Midwest, and he was self-made-at fourteen he had been the chief production director at a start-up TV station in Aurora, Illinois. (His mother would drop him off there every day after school.) ""I liked being successful when I was working, and I was smart,"" he told BusinessWeek earlier this year. But unlike many of his Enron colleagues, Skilling wasn't deliberate and soft-spoken and happy to go home at five o'clock; he was anxious and excitable, and nothing, but nothing excited him more than what he would come to call ""intellectual capital."" He loved being smart, and he loved being surrounded by smart people. He graduated from Southern Methodist University, went into banking-assets and liability management-and took on Harvard Business School, where he graduated in the top 5 percent of his class. Then Skilling took the next step on what was then the new, souped-up path to American success: He joined Manhattan's McKinsey and Company as a business consultant, and that is where Ken Lay found him in 1985.  It is often said of Lay that his instincts for hiring the best are flawless, and his choice of Skilling probably saved the company. Skilling was above all an expert at markets and how they worked. While everyone else was worrying about the gluts and the shortages that defined the gas industry, he alone saw the parallels between gas and other businesses. And so in a world where credit was nearly impossible to come by, Skilling came up with what he called the Gas Bank, which contractually guaranteed both the supply and the price of gas to a network of suppliers and consumers. Enron would not be a broker but a banker. It would buy and sell the gas itself and assume the risk involved. And Enron would make money on transactions, much like an investment bank would. Skilling worked up some numbers and found them ""absolutely compelling."" Then the McKinsey consultant took the idea to a meeting of about 25 Enron executives. He had a one-page presentation. ""Almost to a person,"" Skilling says, ""they thought it was stupid."" Almost. After Skilling left the meeting dejected, he walked Ken Lay to an elevator and apologized. Lay listened and then said, ""Let's go."" The Gas Bank was not an overnight success. For months Skilling woke up in a cold sweat, sure he had ruined not only his career but the careers of dozens of colleagues who had assisted him. In fact, he had come upon one of those divides that seem to define his life: ""I believed this whole world would be different, a huge breakthrough"" is the way Skilling puts it today, and even if he is typically immodest, he was right. Fairly soon after launching, the company sold $800 million worth of gas in a week. True to Skilling's character, success turned out to be a matter of old versus new: He says the joke around Enron was that if a company's CEO was under fifty, ""We were in."" And he was in too: In 1990 Skilling finally left McKinsey and joined Enron as the head of Enron Finance Corporation, a new division created just for him. In 1991 that company closed a deal that earned $11 million in profit. After that, says Skilling, ""we never looked back."" Skilling and Lay also realized that the Gas Bank couldn't work unless it had a trading component. Myriad trades were needed to build the market that would make the project go. But by buying and selling enormous quantities of gas, Enron not only constructed a market but almost instantly came to dominate it. The company had the best contacts, the best intelligence, and the best access to supplies. That, in turn, attracted more customers who wanted to be part of the play. With so many customers in its pocket, Enron could better predict the direction of the market and could use that knowledge to make trades for its own benefit-Enron could in effect bet on which way the price of gas would go, as one might do with pork bellies or soybeans, but with startling accuracy, thereby generating profits higher than anyone could have ever imagined. THIS CHANGE COULD NEVER HAVE OCCURRED without another change Skilling had made: He created, within Enron, a new culture to match its new trading business. The idea was to build a ""knowledge-based business,"" which demanded a skill set not exactly prized by Enron's employees from the old HNG days. Most were deliberate, cautious, responsible, somewhat defensive people, most of them men, of course-the kind of people you'd expect to find working in an industry regulated by the federal government. But now the company needed bolder people for its bold new era: that included anyone who wanted to make money-lots of money-for themselves and for the company. ""Enron was going to create a niche for itself or die,"" one former executive explains. ""The people who had narrow views eventually were forced out, because if they had narrow views about other things, they had narrow views about the market."" Skilling wanted smart people but not just any smart people. He wanted the smartest people from schools like Harvard, Stanford, and maybe, Rice. And because his firm was now acting more like a bank than a pipeline company, he wanted to draw from the pool of recruits that would be attracted to the biggest and best investment banks, like Merrill Lynch or Credit Suisse First Boston. In addition to being smart, Enron people were also supposed to be ""aggressive."" You were right for Enron if you didn't want to wait until you were thirty to close your own deals or move up in an organization.  You could see what he was looking for on ""Super Saturdays"" at the Houston headquarters: eight fifty-minute interviews with ten minute breaks in between-the company might herd as many as four hundred people through in just one day. They were scored from 1 to 5 on their smarts, their problem-solving ability, their passion for hard work, and what at Enron was called ""a sense of urgency."" People who scored less than 2.5 were scratched. The shrewdest candidates knew how to work Enron before they were even hired: These were the types that automatically turned down the company's first offer, knowing Enron would come back with more. The starting salary was around $80,000. Maybe it wasn't a fortune-yet-but the signing bonus, about $20,000, was more than enough for a lease on the obligatory Porsche Boxster or one of the lofts being renovated close to downtown. (Enron people didn't live in far-flung suburbs. Suburbs were uncool and too far from the office.) For the lucky winners, Enron offered the corporate equivalent of a gifted-and-talented program. New associates learned the latest techniques for structuring energy deals, and there were rotations at Enron offices around the globe. The hours were long, but every possible need was taken care of. A company concierge handled all the things important people couldn't be bothered with: picking up dry cleaning or prescriptions, shining shoes, cleaning the house, planning a vacation. Of course, a lot of people who worked for Enron never got to take vacations-they were too busy making money-but they could use the company gym and the company's personal trainers. If they were overweight or wanted to quit smoking, they could join Enron's Wellness Program. Massages were offered six days a week, from seven in the morning until ten at night. ""They were so cutting edge,"" rhapsodizes someone involved with the company health care program at the time. ""They really thought about the psychology and what it took to keep these people going."" Skilling handed out titles analogous to those at Wall Street firms-analysts, associates, directors, and managing directors-but everyone knew that those titles didn't really matter. Money did. Instead of competitive salaries and decent bonuses, Enron offered competitive salaries and merit-based bonuses-with no cap. ""If you really worked hard and delivered results, you could make a lot of money,"" says Ken Rice, who stayed with Enron for 21 years until resigning recently as the head of the company's faltering broadband division. Or, as the saying goes, you got to eat what you killed. Gas traders with two or three years of experience could wind up with a $1 million bonus. And the more you produced, the closer you got to Jeff: Real hot dogs joined him glacier hiking in Patagonia, Land Cruiser racing in Australia, or off-road motorcycling in a re-creation of the Baja 1,000 race, ending at a spectacular Mexican villa. ""Every time he'd speak, I'd believe everything he'd say,"" one loyalist says.  And why not? By 1995 Enron had become North America's largest natural-gas merchant, controlling 20 percent of the market. But at a company where the buzzword was ""aggressive,"" that was no place to stop: Skilling and Lay believed the Gas Bank model could easily be applied to the electricity business. Firmly committed to the notion that a deregulated market meant better service at lower prices for consumers (and untold profits for Enron), they began barnstorming the country, pressing their case with entrenched power company presidents (who, with their multimillion-dollar salaries and monopoly service areas, had little incentive to change) and energy regulators (who were somewhat more receptive, thanks in part to Enron's generous lobbying efforts). But the biggest winner of all was probably Jeff Skilling. In 1997 Ken Lay made him the president and chief operating officer of the company. By then, the division known as Enron Capital and Trade Resources was the nations largest wholesale buyer and seller of natural gas and electricity. The division had grown from two hundred to two thousand employees, and revenues from $2 billion to $7 billion. ""Mr. Skilling's experience so far with the turmoil in the industry has convinced him that he is on the right track,"" the New York Times noted. Everyone would certainly have thought so: Enron and Skilling had totally transformed one industry and were well on their way to transforming another. ""FIRING UP AN IDEA MACHINE; Enron Is Encouraging the Entrepreneurs Within,"" sang the New York Times in 1999. ""In the staid world of regulated utilities and energy companies, Enron Corp is that gate-crashing Elvis,"" crowed Fortune in 2000. Wall Street was demanding tech-size growth on a tech timetable, and Enron, in 2000, obliged with second quarter earnings of $289 million, up 30 percent from the previous year. That year the company seemed to discover a market a minute: Under Skilling, Enron was trading coal, paper, steel, and even weather. No one blinked when a London wine bar became an Enron client. People drank more in warm weather than cold, so why not buy a hedge against the usual winter downturn? But most exciting to the financial world was Enron's entry into high-tech communications. Because of the company's marketing dominance, EnronOnline became another overnight success, handling $335 billion in commodity trades online in 2000. Enron, as usual, made its money on the spread between the bid price and the asking price. Then there was the broadband business: To Enron, trading excess capacity in large, high-speed fiber-optic networks (empty lanes on the fabled information highway) wasn't that different from trading the capacity of natural gas pipelines. So Enron created a market for what the industry calls bandwidth. Soon after, it also announced a twenty-year deal with Blockbuster to deliver movies on demand electronically to people in their homes. Enron looked like a company that couldn't lose. ""Its strategy of building businesses, shedding hard assets, and trading various commodities can help it do well even in an uncertain market,"" BusinessWeek insisted. There was, however, another reason Enron did so well in such a short time: the company's hard-nosed approach toward its customers. The old notion of customer service was based on the long haul-you had to nurse and coddle customers to keep them. But Enron had new markets and new ideas-customers had to come to it. Over time, the company stopping referring to its business clients as customers and began calling them ""counterparties."" Skilling wanted the biggest profits on the shortest timetable: Gains were maximized by creating, owning, and then abandoning a market before it became overtaxed and overregulated. So if you wanted to launch a high-risk venture quickly-such as Zilkha Energy's new high-tech approach to drilling for oil-you got your financing from Enron because a bank would take forever to underwrite the project, if it ever would. But because Enron invented its markets and subsequently dominated them, Enron could set the terms of its deals, from the timeline to the method of accounting to whether the deal happened at all.  While many businesses used what was known in the industry as ""mark-to-market accounting,"" for instance, Enron used it on an unprecedented scale. The company priced their deals at current market value-but it was always Enron's idea of the market value; companies that balked at their pricing didn't get deals. And while old-fashioned companies spread their profits out like annuities over a period of years, Enron took most of its profit up-front. However many millions would be made on a deal that covered several years, they went on the books in the current year. If a few analysts thought there might be something fishy about what they called ""subjective accounting,"" investors didn't particularly care as long as the profits rolled in. As the market fluctuated and the landscape changed, the company might abandon a project that had been in the works for months because its profit margins weren't going to be high enough. ""Enron is known for leaving people at the altar,"" says one former employee. Winning the highest possible profits for the company could even extend to Enron's attitude toward charity. When a fundraiser for the Houston READ Commission, a literacy group, called on Enron for a contribution, it was suggested that he start raising money for Enron's competing literacy charity: ""Even the person who was supposed to give money away for Enron was supposed to make money for Enron,"" he says. As Enron became more and more successful, the culture Skilling had created took on a dark side: The competition turned inward. As one member of the Enron family put it, ""It became a company full of mercenaries."" The change started at the bottom. As Enron's domination of the energy market grew, most of the recruiting frills fell away. New associates were treated much like the commodities the company traded. Global Change's Enron spies reported overhearing orders like ""I need a smart person-go buy me one"" or ""Buy me an intelligent slave, quick."" Enron had never been the kind of place where people sang to you on your birthday, but now the workaholism bordered on self-parody: A Random Acts of Kindness program lasted only a few months. It was too disruptive. People couldn't get their work done. And, of course, Enron had a program for institutionalizing creative tension. The Performance Review Committee, which had initially been installed by Skilling in the Capital group, became known as the harshest forced ranking system in the country. Employees were rated on a scale of one to five, and those with fives were usually gone within six months. (The PRC's nickname quickly became ""rank and yank."") It was a point of pride that Skilling's division replaced 15 percent of its workforce every year. As one Skilling associate put it, ""Jeff viewed this like turning over the inventory in a grocery store."" Skilling's approach to business-get in and get out-had become Enron's attitude toward its workers. In time, it would become many workers' attitude toward the company. Teamwork, never that valuable in a trading culture, went the way of the eyeshade and the abacus. If protocol required an Enron higher-up to come from Europe to help with a project in the Third World, he might help-or he might not, depending on whether another, potentially more lucrative project was pending elsewhere. Everyone felt the pressure to perform on a massive scale at massive speed: ""They were so goal oriented toward immediate gratification that they lost sight of the future,"" says one former employee. Anyone who couldn't close deals within a quarter was punished with bad PRC scores, as were the higher-ups who had backed them. Past errors and old grudges were dredged up so often as new ammunition in PRC meetings that the phrase ""No old tapes"" became an Enron clich?. ""People went from being geniuses to idiots overnight,"" says one former Enron executive. In such a hothouse, paranoia flowered. New contracts contained highly restrictive confidentiality agreements about anything pertaining to the company. E-mail was monitored. A former executive routinely carried two laptops, one for the company and one for himself. People may have been rich at Enron, but they weren't necessarily happy. One recruiter described the culture this way: ""They roll you over and slit your throat and watch your eyes while you bleed to death."" BEFORE JEFF SKILLING COULD TRANSFORM ENRON from the world's leading energy company into the world's leading company, he had to make one more change: Just as he had done ten years before, Skilling had to purge the company of its remaining old order. Where Enron once prized cautious executives who dealt with tangible assets like pipelines, it now valued bold executives who dealt with intangible assets. Pipelines, power plants-they may have been Enron's pride, but Skilling wanted them gone. Expensive, long-term building projects had no place when Wall Street was devoted to quick profits and enormous returns on investment capital, and Skilling knew it. ""It wasn't the time for long-term approaches,"" an Enron executive says of Wall Street's mood. ""It was the technology era."" To rid Enron of the last vestiges of its past, Skilling had to take on Rebecca Mark, long considered his rival for the CEO's job. Mark was for many years the poster child for the Enron way: Young, attractive, aggressive-her nickname was Mark the Shark-she came from sturdy Midwestern stock but had the requisite Harvard MBA. Mark was largely responsible for the success of Enron International, the asset-heavy side of the company where she developed $20 billion worth of gas and power plants, which accounted for 40 percent of Enron's profits in 1998. For this she reaped breathtaking compensation-one Enron executive estimated $10 million-and adoring press clips, including two appearances on Fortune's list of the fifty most powerful women in corporate America. But then Mark ran into trouble with a gas-fired power plant in Dabhol, India, one of the largest ever constructed. She had played the game the Enron way: Taking Enron into a new market, she had finagled low import taxes (20 percent instead of the usual 53) and hung in through 24 lawsuits and three changes in government. But the time and expense needed to make India and other Enron plants around the globe successful did not mesh with Enron's goals, and Skilling's impatience with Mark grew. Forcing Mark out, however, was no easy matter. Key executives left, divisions were dismantled, but she remained. The truth was Enron didn't mind firing lower-level employees, but it hated to fire the kind of aggressive, relentless people it tended to promote. The company preferred humiliation-keeping a director in his cubicle, say, but failing to include him in the glamour deals, or kicking someone upstairs with a fancy title. (One particularly difficult executive won a few years at graduate school, gratis.) A company as smart as Enron could probably deduce too that dispatching one of the most visible businesswomen in the country would provoke a public-relations disaster. So Lay and Skilling did something classically Enronian: They gave Mark her own company. Despite Skilling's contempt for asset-heavy businesses, Enron spent more than $2 billion to buy a run-of-the-mill British water utility that could serve as Enron's entry into the emerging world of water privatization. Mark was put in charge of making Enron, yes, the world's greatest water company. Azurix, as the new business was called, looked like another sure thing: Its IPO in 1999 raised $695 million.  But Mark had to succeed on Enron's increasingly abbreviated timetable in a business fraught with political and emotional complexities. Water is not like gas or electricity-owners and governments are a lot less willing to give it up, even for lots of money. The company stumbled, layoffs commenced, and confidence evaporated. By August 2000 the stock price, which had started out at $19, had fallen to $5. Mark's resignation followed, and Azurix, much diminished, was folded into Enron. ""I think it's best for Rebecca to start afresh,"" Lay, who had been a mentor to Mark, told the Wall Street Journal. Or as one critic put it, ""They were more interested in destroying the old culture than running a business.""  As 2000 drew to a close, Skilling was in total command. In December Ken Lay announced the inevitable: ""The best time for the succession to occur is when the company is doing well,"" he told the press. ""Enron is doing extremely well now."" In February 2001 Jeff Skilling took over the CEO's job. ALMOST IMMEDIATELY THE TROUBLE STARTED. Enron's domination of the electric-power market made it an instant target in the California deregulation debacle. Both PBS's Frontline and the New York Times took on Enron, portraying the company as a heartless colossus that used its influence in Washington (Lay and Enron's political action committee are the top contributors to George W. Bush) to force old people on fixed incomes to choose between buying food or electricity. Skilling and Lay appeared on camera singing belligerent anthems to the free market, while another memorable scene juxtaposed one of the company's jackallike traders against a hapless state employee in California, as both tried to buy power online. The Times reported that Lay had tried to persuade a new federal commissioner to change his views on energy deregulation. The bad press was, to say the least, ironic: Just as the media was pounding Enron for its omnipotence, Wall Street was discovering its weaknesses. By late March the stock price had slid to $50 a share from $80 in January. Within Enron, the asset-based divisions took the rap for the decline. (The India plant continued to be enormously costly, at least in part because of constant turnover within Enron's management team.) But the California situation was more visible and therefore more damaging, despite Enron's claim that the state had never built enough power plants to service its population and never properly managed those it had. ""For three months Gray Davis did a very good job of blaming us,"" says Mark Palmer, a vice president for corporate communications. ""We were a Texas company. There was a Texan in the White House. California was a state that didn't put him in office, and his biggest contributor was a Texas energy company. Performance is going to take care of our stock price. The truth will take care of Gray Davis."" (California utilities still owe Enron $500 million, another reason stockholders might be panicky.) But more problematic than the crisis itself was Skilling's all too apparent lack of contrition. Facing down his critics, he cracked a joke comparing California with the Titanic. (""At least the Titanic went down with its lights on."") But the biggest problem was Enron's telecommunications division, which had been responsible for at least one third of its heady stock price. Investors believed that Enron could revolutionize high-speed communications, just as it had revolutionized gas and power. Enron estimated the global market for buying and selling space over fiber-optic cable would grow from $155 billion in 2001 to $383 billion by 2004-but then the tech bubble burst. So too did the much-hyped movies-on-demand deal with Blockbuster. For the first time in its confoundingly successful life, Enron had nothing new to take to market. Like the popular high school girl who suddenly packs on a few pounds, Enron suddenly looked less alluring to Wall Street. Skilling launched a campaign to keep Enron's most important cheerleaders, the stock analysts, in the tent, but he wasn't cut out to be a supplicant. During the reporting of first quarter profits, he called an analyst who challenged Enron's financial reporting an ""asshole."" When the company reported hefty second quarter profits, many analysts questioned whether those profits had come from the generation of new business or from the sale of old assets. Ignoring the growing chorus critical of Enron's accounting, Skilling promised, as he always had, that innovations were just around the corner. ""There wasn't any positive news,"" Carol Coale, of Prudential Financial, says now. ""Basically, he talked me out of a downgrade."" The business press, so generous in the past, turned surly. Fortune had asked in March whether Enron was overpriced. (""Start with a pretty straightforward question: How exactly does Enron make its money?"") The routine cashing in of stock options that were about to expire by key executives was portrayed in the media as a fire sale. (Skilling had sold $33 million worth, Ken Lay and Ken Rice close to four times that amount.) Then the Wall Street Journal reported on a fund run by the CFO that had been a source of strife within the company. (It was essentially risk management against Enron's possible failures.) Every negative story seemed to produce a concurrent drop in the stock price: By late August it had fallen below $40. Enron, so institutionally unforgiving, finally got a taste of its own medicine. ""When Wall Street is in love with a stock, they're forgiving of something like accounting,"" says Carol Coale. ""When a company falls out of favor, all these issues carry more weight."" This fact was not lost on people inside the company, who suddenly started experiencing an attack of conscience. Those who had looked the other way as the most powerful Enron executives dumped their wives and married their secretaries or carried on flagrant interoffice affairs now saw the error of their ways. ""It just created an attitude,"" one executive still at Enron says. ""If senior people are doing that, why are we held to a higher standard? There was a real culture of 'We're above everyone else.'""  Loyalty had never been prized at Enron, so there was no reason to expect it now. An old-fashioned, slow-moving company like Exxon could demand hardship duty in Baku with the promise of greater rewards down the road. ""But,"" as one Houston oilman explains, ""if you have to negotiate a hardship duty with someone who doesn't have loyalty and has money, then you have a corporation that's better suited for good times than bad."" As it turned out, that description applied to Jeff Skilling too. As the stock price stubbornly refused to ascend, he made no secret of his unhappiness and frustration. Then, after a trip to visit the families of three employees killed at a plant in England, he had an epiphany: Life was short; for him, Enron was over. Ever stoic, Ken Lay returned to the CEO's office, named a new president, arranged a trip to New York to calm analysts and investors, and promised a kinder, gentler Enron in the future. Trading anything and everything was out. The company, Lay says, will still innovate but ""innovate much closer to our core."" As for the culture: ""Things like the Performance Review Committee, I think we could have applied better. By trying to categorize people into so many different categories, you ended up creating a morale problem."" That Skilling's supposedly brilliant colleagues were as shocked at the news of his departure as the rest of the business community may be testament to their lack of emotional intelligence. Despite Skilling's lengthy tenure with Enron, he'd always been contemptuous of the long haul; he'd always believed in cutting losses and moving on. But now that he was abandoning them when the company was in trouble, it was different. ""Even Jeff's biggest detractors wouldn't have wanted him to walk out the door,"" one loyalist admits. But on the day we meet, Skilling is looking forward, not back. ""Look,"" he says with finality, ""ninety percent of my net worth is in Enron. Were my interests aligned with the shareholders? Absolutely."" Free of falling stock prices and shareholder pressures, he is nestling himself back into the world of ideas. His eyes flash as he talks about new technologies. ""The first wave never gets it right,"" he says. ""The stand-alone dot-coms didn't work, but the technological applications will create a second wave that will change the world."" Houston, he promises, will become the world's center of commodity trading, and he intends to be a part of it. In fact, he is already shopping for office space. ""This is the second wave, and Enron's got it,"" he says, almost breathless. ""There are thousands of people running around the streets of Houston that get it."" subject: FW: Texas Monthly November 2001: How Enron Blew It "

We understand that you are concerned about the timing of the move to a new Savings Plan administrator and the restricted access to your investment funds during the upcoming transition period scheduled to take place beginning at 3:00PM CST on October 26 and ending at 8:00AM CST on November 20.   We have been working with Hewitt and Northern Trust since July.  We understand your concerns and are committed to making this transition period as short as possible without jeopardizing the reconciliation of both the Plan in total or your account in particular.   Remember that the Enron Corp. Savings Plan is an investment vehicle for your long-term financial goals.  The Enron plan will continue to offer a variety of investment opportunities with different levels of risk.   As always, we advise you to review your overall investment strategy and carefully weigh the potential earnings of each investment choice against its risk before making investment decisions that are aligned with your long-term financial plans and your risk tolerance.  For that reason, it is critical that ALL trades among your investment funds be completed by 3:00 PM CST Friday, October 26 before the transition period begins. subject: IMPORTANT-To All Domestic Employees who Participate in the Enron Corp Savings Plan "

bryant@cheatsheets.net,0,0,0.898,5b9749c7-df3d-4f4a-8a52-a01260cf7663,"body: Hi Folks, Another wild week in the NFL.   We've got Footballguy Scott Luebke's Week 7 Upgrade - Downgrade - Waiver Wire Picks. Before we get to that though, let me throw out something I posted today on our message boards regarding owners who beat themselves up second guessing themselves.   This season has been as tough to predict as any in recent memory and I thought this might be something some of you might need to hear. From our Message Boards www.footballguystalk.com One of our message board members was (justifiably) frustrated with watching Trung Canidate blow up on his bench while Ahman Green and Ricky Williams fared less well as his starters. My reply to him: Don't be down on yourself.   That's the nature of the game.   There is no way you bench Ricky Williams or Ahman Green for Canidate when Canidate was such a question mark last week.   You did what just about every one of us would have done I'm guessing. It's part of the game.   Is it frustrating?   Sure it is.   But it's still part of the game.   In my local league last week, I took a chance again on Antonio Freeman after starting him for the first few weeks (but not week 5 - Aargh... )   Did it play out?   No, it didn't.   I had guys on my bench who outscored him.   But looking back on everything I knew with Minnesota and Billy Schroeder, it was the right call for me. I learned a long time ago the secret to Fantasy Football.   You just have to take the best info you can assemble, make your call and let the players do the rest.   Just like a real GM.   You can only do so much. If you got beat because you didn't know Terry Glenn was out and you started him, well, that's your bad.   But if you got beat because Trung Canidate decided to play the game of his life, and proven RBs Williams and Green did not, well, that's not your fault. I promise you, if you can predict things to that degree, you need to quit your job and head to Vegas. Control what you can control.   Bust your butt to know all you can know. Make the best decisions you can make and be comfortable you've done all you can do.   After that, just enjoy the games.   Trust me, you'll be a better owner because of it. Ok, let's jump to Scott's report for this week. Have a great week, everyone. Joe /**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/ Upgrades QB - Tom Brady (Waiver Wire) - 5 touchdown passes in the last 2 weeks deserves an upgrade in my book.  More importantly, Brady has yet to throw an interception this season.  When Bledsoe returns from injury, the Patriots' coaching staff will have a very difficult decision to make.   There's even some talk that Bledsoe might not return this season.   Right now, Brady deserves a pickup by any fantasy team needing a quarterback. QB - Tim Couch - The yardage numbers won't win any awards, but the 4 touchdowns in the last 2 games is impressive.  Couch is starting to show signs of becoming a very good quarterback in this league.  Keep in mind, a tough schedule looms ahead for Couch.  However, with the Browns offense improving, he should be considered a top quarterback for teams in a keeper league looking towards the future. QB - Doug Flutie - The Flutie magic continues to strike.  He's not the best fantasy quarterback, but numerous fantasy teams can be aided by inserting Flutie into the lineup.  With Curtis Conway and Jeff Graham staying healthy, Flutie should be considered a top 15 quarterback this season.  With a strong rushing game keeping defenses honest, look for Flutie to post numbers similar to Sunday on occasion.  280 passing yards and 2 scores is respectable against a tough Denver defense. RB - Anthony Thomas -The A-Train continues to ride into fantasy starting lineups.  We've been hyping him for weeks and it appears he'll be named the official starter in Chicago shortly.  With 188 yards and a touchdown on Sunday, can the Bears afford to keep him out of the lineup?  I think not. RB - Trung Canidate - Faulk owners need not worry about using Canidate as a filler.  232 total yards and 2 touchdowns...WOW!   At the very least he'll see more action even when Faulk is back. RB - Jerome Bettis - Bettis has rolled to 4 consecutive 100-yard games. Look for this trend to continue.  With the Steelers defense playing excellent and Kordell Stewart limiting turnovers, look for Bettis to have more good games as the season progresses. RB - Michael Pittman - We told you to jump off the Thomas Jones bandwagon and hop on the Pittman express earlier in the season.   With Pittman seeing 80% of the carries and more importantly producing, all looks good for Pittman owners.  I've never been an advocate of starting Cardinals' running backs though.  After his 137 total yards and a touchdown performance, now may be the time to deal Pittman. RB - Jason Brookins (Waiver Wire) - Terry Allen's ankle sprain may be all Brookins needs to become the team's starting running back.  He's looked good running behind a pretty solid offensive line, but his carries have been limited due to Allen's presence.  Keep in mind, the Ravens are contacting other teams about trading for another back prior to the trade deadline. Right now, Brookins is a solid waiver wire choice. WR - David Patten (Waiver Wire) - Anyone who rushes, passes and receives for a touchdown in the same game deserves an upgrade.  With Terry Glenn being bothered by a hamstring injury, Patten made the most of his opportunity.  He has looked good over the last few weeks and has shown the ability to make plays, which is needed in the Patriots offense.  Grab him, if you are in need of a receiver. WR - David Terrell (Waiver Wire) - Terrell had a breakout game on Sunday with 7 catches for 91 yards.  More importantly for his fantasy value, Marcus Robinson suffered a serious knee injury and is lost for the season.  The Robinson injury makes way for Terrell to enter the Bears' starting lineup. If you're in need of a receiver, Terrell is the best option in the free agent market, if he is still available. WR - Keyshawn Johnson - Johnson has yet to score a touchdown this season, but he is doing everything else.  Johnson is averaging 8 catches/game and appears unstoppable at times.  However, he did suffer a hip flexor injury late in the game and appears questionable for this week's game. WR - Johnnie Morton - Morton continues to impress this season.  He has surpassed the 100-yard mark 3 times this season and scored 3 touchdowns. With Germane Crowell and Herman Moore out for the season, Morton becomes the team's #1 wide receiver.  Morton owners should be happy. WR - David Boston - Plain and simple, Boston is bigger, faster and better than any defensive back on the field.  In his first 5 games, Boston is averaging 96 receiving yards/game.  Keep him in your lineup every week. WR - Jeff Graham - With the San Diego running game and LaDainian Tomlinson garnering a lot of attention, the receiving corps is able to see plenty of open spaces downfield.  Graham scored his first two touchdowns of the season and gained 107 yards on Sunday.  With defenses focusing on Tomlinson, look for Flutie to find Graham for 5-6 more touchdown passes this season. WR - Rod Gardner (Waiver Wire) - While Michael Westbrook appears invisible, Gardner is impressing on the other side of the field.  208 yards and a touchdown (with another score called back), Gardner is starting to claim the title of ""best rookie receiver"".  Grab him, if he is available in your league.  Gardner is the lone bright spot in the Redskins passing game. TE - Bubba Franks - Franks has been diagnosed with Cris Carter disease because ""All he does is catch touchdowns"".  6 touchdowns in 6 games.  If only he can start picking up yardage points. TE - Cam Cleeland - Cleeland scored another touchdown on Sunday to increase the total to 4 scores this season.  With Aaron Brooks struggling to find his wide receivers in the red zone, Cleeland's value should remain high for a little while longer. /**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/ Downgrades QB - Aaron Brooks - Brooks has been struggling trying to find his receivers, especially in the red zone.  With just 4 touchdowns in his last 4 games, Brooks is in a minor slump.  There's no need to jump off his bandwagon.  On the flip side, an upturn in production is possible over the next 4 weeks as New Orleans faces: St. Louis, NY Jets, San Francisco and Indianapolis.  But for now, we're a little worried and Brooks needs to be downgraded with our fingers crossed to see him upgraded starting next week. QB - Elvis Grbac - Two injuries in two weeks have Grbac downgraded once again this week.  Without a consistent running game, look for Grbac's struggles to continue.  For now, Grbac is expected to be listed as questionable for this week's game against Jacksonville. QB - Charlie Batch - With 338 yards and 3 touchdowns, many would think that Batch deserves an upgrade.  Well, if the box scores were the only thing studied, this would be the case.  However, the season ending injury to Batch's #1 receiving option, Germane Crowell, gives Batch a downgrade in my book.  With both Crowell and Herman Moore out for the season, Batch must rely on Johnnie Morton and Larry Foster as his starting receivers...not a good sign. QB - Vinny Testaverde - Testaverde was unable to get anything going against the Rams on Sunday.  With the Rams leading by a significant margin, Testaverde was benched in order to get Chad Pennington some playing time. All in all, not a good sign for Testaverde owners.  Testaverde's yardage numbers are poor this season.  However, he has thrown for multiple touchdowns in 3 of his 6 games this season. RB - Warrick Dunn - Dunn suffered a hamstring strain on Sunday against the Steelers.  Look for Dunn to be listed as questionable on the injury report this week.  With the Vikings mediocre defense coming to town, Dunn's owners can't be very happy with this recent turn of events.  Joe's email updates will keep you posted on the latest Dunn news. RB - Michael Bennett - Chapman was able to rush for 90 yards on 22 carries during Sunday's game versus Green Bay.  This is bad news for the unproductive, injured Bennett.  With Bennett failing to clear the 60-yard mark this season, his starting job is in jeopardy.  Keep an eye on this situation. RB - James Stewart - Stewart suffered an ankle sprain in Sunday's loss to the Titans.  He was limited to 17 yards on 9 carries before leaving the game.  Expect him to be listed as questionable for this week's game.  As more of a straight ahead runner, Stewart may be able to play on the injury and be somewhat effective.  With this week's game on astroturf, the Lions may decide to rest Stewart and get him back to 100% health.  Regardless, any kind of injury to an often injured player deserves a downgrade. RB - Tim Biakabatuka - Biakabatuka suffered a broken foot and is lost for the season. RB - Terry Allen - Allen was limited to 12 yards on 3 carries after suffering an ankle injury on Sunday.  Backup Jason Brookins replaced Allen and looked decent.  If Allen misses any action, Brookins may replace him as the team's starter with one good performance.  The Ravens are exploring trade options for another running back prior to the trade deadline, so the Ravens RB situation is cloudy at the current time. RB - James Allen - We've been hyping Anthony Thomas for weeks and it appears he will soon be named the official starting RB in Chicago.  Plain and simple, Allen has been horrible this season.  With Thomas gaining 188 yards on 22 carries, Allen will be relegated to spot duty. RB - LaDainian Tomlinson - Tomlinson was limited to 58 yards on 25 carries and 0 touchdowns against a stingy Broncos defense.  It was bound to happen that a team would shut down Tomlinson.  Tomlinson owners should be happy that he received 25 carries despite being ineffective.  Just a slight downgrade to show he's human.  Keep him in your lineup. WR - Marcus Robinson - Robinson suffered a torn ACL and MCL and is lost for the season. WR - Germane Crowell - Crowell suffered a torn patella tendon and is lost for the season. WR - Terry Glenn - Currently, Glenn is suffering from a hamstring strain that he suffered in last week's practice.  He missed Sunday's game and witnessed the ""David Patten Show"".  With Patten showcasing his playmaking skills, look for Glenn's touches to be reduced when he returns from injury. Previously, Glenn was considered the only playmaker on the Patriots offense. Glenn can post dazzling numbers, but his inconsistency has hurt fantasy owners in the past and this should once again be the case this season. WR - Darney Scott - Scott's role in the Bengals' offense has seemingly been reduced in the last few weeks.  After suffering a rib injury that forced Scott out of Sunday's game, Kitna started finding Peter Warrick on a consistent basis.  With Kitna starting to build a rapport with the talented 2nd year wideout from Florida St., Scott now appears to be the team's second option in the passing game. WR - Marvin Minnis - Minnis has been non existent in the Chiefs offense since week 1.  With Sylvester Morris out for the season, Minnis looked ready to take over the role and produce quality numbers.  With Trent Green struggling at quarterback, Minnis' fantasy impact has been minimal at best. If Minnis is a starter on your roster, your receiving corps needs some serious help. /**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/ Waiver Wire QB - Tom Brady - 5 touchdown passes in the last 2 weeks deserves an upgrade in my book.  More importantly, Brady has yet to throw an interception this season.  When Bledsoe returns from injury, the Patriots' coaching staff will have a very difficult decision to make.  Right now, Brady deserves a pickup by any fantasy team needing a quarterback. RB - Richard Huntley - Huntley has been named the team's starter after the season ending foot injury to Tim Biakabatuka.  It was only a matter of time before Biakabatuka would get injured or benched again.  With the Panthers facing the Jets pitiful run defense this week, Huntley should pay instant dividends. RB - Doug Chapman - Chapman was able to rush for 90 yards on 22 carries in replacement of the injured Michael Bennett.  With the unproductive Bennett suffering from an ankle injury, Chapman will be given the chance to earn the team's starting running back job.  Grab him, if he is available. RB - Jason Brookins - Terry Allen's ankle sprain may be all Brookins needs to become the team's starting running back.  He's looked good running behind a quality offensive line, but his carries have been limited due to Allen's presence.  Keep in mind, the Ravens are contacting other teams about trading for another back prior to the trade deadline.  Right now, Brookins is a solid waiver wire choice. WR - David Patten - Anyone who rushes, passes and receives for a touchdown in the same game deserves an upgrade.  With Terry Glenn being bothered by a hamstring injury, Patten made the most of his opportunity.  He has looked good over the last few weeks and has shown the ability to make plays, which is needed in the Patriots offense.  Grab him, if you are in need of a receiver. WR - David Terrell - Terrell had a breakout game on Sunday with 7 catches for 91 yards.  More importantly for his fantasy value, Marcus Robinson suffered a serious knee injury and is lost for the season.  The Robinson injury makes way for Terrell to enter the Bears' starting lineup.  If you're in need of a receiver, Terrell is the best option in the free agent market, if he is still available. WR - Rod Gardner - While Michael Westbrook appears invisible, Gardner is impressing on the other side of the field.  208 yards and a touchdown (with another score called back), Gardner is starting to claim the title of ""best rookie receiver"".  Grab him, if he is available in your league.  Gardner is the lone bright spot in the Redskins passing game. WR - Larry Foster - With Herman Moore and Germaine Crowell out for the season, the Lions will insert Larry Foster into the lineup.  Foster is a talented receiver out of LSU with playmaking skills.  If you are in a deep league and in need of receiver help, give Foster a shot on your team. /**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/ Bryant Analytics, Inc.

ken.shulklapper@enron.com,1,1,0.898,349fa407-ae1e-497b-a6c8-ebf394d1409b,"body: From Enron's Proxy:       During 2000, certain Enron subsidiaries and affiliates (defined for purposes of the following paragraphs, ""Enron"") entered into a number of transactions with LJM2 Co-Investment, L.P. (""LJM2""), a private investment company that primarily engages in acquiring or investing in energy and communications-related investments, primarily involving either assets Enron had decided to sell or risk management activities intended to limit Enron's exposure to price and value fluctuations with respect to various assets. Andrew S. Fastow, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Enron, is the managing member of LJM2's general partner. The general partner of LJM2 is entitled to receive a percentage of the profits of LJM2 in excess of the general partner's portion of the total capital contributed to LJM2, depending upon the performance of the investments made by LJM2. In ten of these transactions LJM2 acquired various debt and equity securities, or other ownership interests, from Enron that were directly or indirectly engaged in the domestic and/or international energy or communications business, while in one transaction LJM2 acquired dark fiber from an Enron subsidiary. The aggregate consideration agreed to be paid to Enron pursuant to these eleven transactions was approximately $213 million. Also during 2000, LJM2 sold to Enron certain merchant investment interests for a total consideration of approximately $76 million.      Also, during 2000, Enron engaged in other transactions with LJM2 intended to manage price and value risk with regard to certain merchant and similar assets by entering into derivatives, including swaps, puts, and collars. As part of such risk management transactions, LJM2 purchased equity interests in four structured finance vehicles for a total of approximately $127 million. Enron, in turn, contributed a combination of assets, Enron notes payable, restricted shares of outstanding Enron stock (and the restricted right to receive additional Enron shares) in exchange for interests in the vehicles. Enron and LJM2 subsequently entered into derivative transactions through these four vehicles with a combined notional amount of approximately $2.1 billion. These transactions occurred in the ordinary course of Enron's business and were negotiated on an arm's length basis with senior officers of Enron other than Mr. Fastow. Management believes that the terms of the transactions were reasonable and no less favorable than the terms of similar arrangements with unrelated third parties.   subject: FW: "
bryant@cheatsheets.net,0,0,0.898,76dea64c-c9c3-42b5-a858-c57b04ac448a,"body: Hi Folks, As we reported to you last night, Tshimanga Biakabutuka is out for the year with a broken foot.   That brought an avalanche of ""who's the starter now?"" emails. Fortunately, Coach George Seifert answered that today in his weekly press conference. From the Official Panthers Website: http://www.cpanthers.com/games/index.cfm?cont_id=75023 Seifert on Sunday's Injuries:   ""There is significant loss as far as a couple of our players. Tshimanga Biakabutuka's right foot was operated on last night. It will be some time before he will be able to be active. By some time, I mean a number of months. He is obviously going to go on injured reserve and won't play this season. Also, an ACL tear was sustained by Kevin Donnalley in his right knee, and he is going to be placed on injured reserve as well. It will probably be a couple of weeks before he has that operated on. Hannibal Navies broke his right arm, and he is being operated on today. He will be out a minimum of six weeks. It could be longer, so there are some decisions that have to be made there, also. Those are the three most significant injuries. I don't have anything to report specifically about any others right now. Steve Smith's knee is bothering him. But I've got to wait until Wednesday when I can be more accurate about who is going to be available to us. Obviously, Biakabutuka, Donnalley and Navies won't be. Dan Morgan will not play. Kory Minor will not play. Deveron Harper will not play. We will wait and see on Jason Peter."" Seifert on running back Richard Huntley:   ""As we go into this next game, Huntley would be our starting running back. He has progressed from the standpoint that he is now healthy. There was a period throughout camp where he didn't practice. So he has a better feel for what we are doing. He hasn't had an awful lot of opportunities, but now is the time when somebody comes to the front. Here's a golden opportunity. He came in here wanting to be the starting back. Now he is going to have his chance to do that."" [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [  OUR VIEW  ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] As Seifert said, this is Huntley's ""Golden Opportunity"".   Not quite the ""Golden Opportunity"" handed to Trung Canidate as the Panthers are a struggling team, but still, Huntley gives you the chance to scoop up an NFL Starting RB and that doesn't happen very often.   The injury to OL Kevin Donnalley will hurt though.   Carolina gets a break this week against the Jets but they have a tough stretch after that with Miami, St. Louis, San Francisco, Atlanta and New Orleans.   So I wouldn't trade the farm to pick him up, but he could be a value if the price is right. More as we hear it. Joe /**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/ Bryant Analytics, Inc.

In the immediate future,  however, the challenge will be in responding to a shifting landscape while  maintaining long-term objectives. * Parties to the Kyoto Protocol are forging ahead with final negotiations,  while the US focus is on when a domestic climate change policy might appear. * The European Union is moving toward development of a unified greenhouse gas  emissions trading scheme, while individual European nations are developing or  implementing their own (potentially incompatible) systems. * Continued technology maturation combined with heightened energy security  concerns is solidifying the foundation of the renewable energy niche, bringing  increased focus on remaining technical and political hurdles. **end** Follow above URL for complete CERA Watch.

bryant@cheatsheets.net,0,0,0.904,aeb2e5a2-76f1-4adb-baa0-6ac935e787fa,"body: James Questionable for Nov 4 Game Entire story:   http://espn.go.com/nfl/news/2001/1026/1269528.html Clipped from the ESPN.com article: INDIANAPOLIS -- Two-time NFL rushing champ Edgerrin James could miss the Indianapolis Colts game next week at Buffalo because of a sprained left knee. James injured the knee with about 41/2 minutes remaining in Thursday's 35-28 victory at Kansas City. James was hurt when his foot stuck in the Arrowhead Stadium grass as linebacker Marvcus Patton tackled him. Colts coach Jim Mora said James had an MRI exam Friday that confirmed he had a sprained knee -- but no structural damage. Mora listed James as questionable, meaning there's a 50-50 chance he would play Nov. 4 against the Bills. ""The MRI showed that it was sprained, which was basically the prognosis last night,"" Mora said. ""I haven't talked to him today, but (trainer) Hunter (Smith) has, and he said Edgerrin felt pretty good."" James and other Colts players were not available Friday because Mora gave them three days off. James won rushing titles in each of his first two NFL seasons and, through six games this season, is in contention for a third straight crown. On Thursday, James carried 27 times for 102 yards. It was his fifth 100-yard game this season and the 24th of his career, which tied the team record set by Eric Dickerson. Earlier this season, James tied Jim Brown as the second-fastest running back to 3,500 yards rushing, which he achieved in 34 games. James has 3,924 yards rushing in his career. The knee injury, however, has put James' streak of 38 consecutive starts in jeopardy. Indianapolis doesn't practice again until Monday, and Mora said he ""doubted"" James would practice then. ""We've still got nine days before we play again,"" Mora said. ""So we're going to take it day by day."" If James cannot go, the Colts appear to have found a more than adequate replacement in backup Dominic Rhodes. Until Thursday, Rhodes, a rookie free agent from Midwestern Texas State, had carried six times for 56 yards. In James' absence Friday, Rhodes burst onto the scene by returning a kickoff 88 yards for one touchdown, then racing 77 yards for another touchdown on his fourth carry. Rhodes' run was the fourth-longest in franchise history and the longest by a Colt since Tom Matte raced 80 yards against the St. Louis Cardinals on Oct. 12, 1964. ""I was just glad to get the opportunity,"" Rhodes said after the game. ""I wish it wasn't because Edgerrin got hurt. (Running backs) Coach (Gene) Huey has been telling me to just hang in there and my time would come. I guess he was right tonight."" Rhodes outran Chiefs defenders to the end zone on both touchdown runs and played well enough to put Mora's mind at ease -- if James cannot play a week from Sunday. ""I feel very good about Dominic Rhodes,"" Mora said. ""He's done nothing but show us he can be a good back in this league. He hits it hard and he has good hands."" That's one reason Rhodes might continue returning kickoffs even if he replaces James against the Bills. Mora said he would wait to see if Terrence Wilkins could return. The wide receiver-returner has missed the last two games with broken ribs. If neither Wilkins nor James plays, Rhodes is likely to see double duty. But Mora remains optimistic that James will heal during the nine-day break between games. ""We'll take it day by day,"" Mora said. ""We'll put him down as questionable right now, but we're hoping he can play."" [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [  OUR VIEW  ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] Clearly, not great news but also better than it might have been.   Dominic Rhodes could be a great insurance pickup if he's still available.   This will certainly be a hot topic and something we'll stay on top of for you.

We  invite you to send your own scouting reports and comments on  players to: gridguru@commissioner.com. You'll get the chance  to be heard by thousands of Fantasy players just like  yourself!  Chris Trautman, LaCrosse, WI: I am stuck on my last starter.  Should I go with Shaun Alexander or 3 WRs and start Marty  Booker? Alexander ripped it up at home two weeks ago and he  is at home again versus a good Miami team, but Booker should  be featured more since Marcus Robinson went down for the  season. G.G.: Alexander has been a revelation in his first two  starts, but now he faces a team that may not back down to  him. The Dolphins have a superb run defense that should not  be judged by its recent failures against Marshall Faulk and  Curtis Martin. Miami will be fired up to face Alexander, who  may have his first forgettable game as a starter. Booker  will face an underrated San Francisco secondary, and is not  destined to have a big day. Neither player seems like a  great start, but we recommend Alexander because he may score  a late TD if the Seahawks have to play catch-up against a  Miami team that gives them all kinds of matchup problems. Mark MacKay, San Diego, CA: Should I start Rod Gardner or  Ike Hilliard this week? Rod had a good Week Six, but Ike is  looking better each week. G.G.: Gardner's huge day means two things. One, he gains  instant Fantasy notice. Two, his next opponent will be  geared to shut him down after extensive film study. The  Giants have been very solid defensively, and will be one of  the better units the rookie has seen so far. Hilliard is  quickly recapturing his old form, and might be the Giants'  No. 1 receiver if Amani Toomer is benched. He'll be facing  Champ Bailey though, so Hilliard is not due for a big week.  Neither player looks like a great start, but we'll go with  Hilliard because of his experience and continuing  improvement. John Kersey, Denver, CO: I have already decided to start  LaDainian Tomlinson. Who should I start as my No. 2 RB -  Jason Brookins, Anthony Thomas or Mike Anderson? G.G: Brookins is the best back on the Baltimore roster, but  the Ravens are still not showing a lot of confidence in  him, so he is a risky start. It is difficult to sit Thomas  after the breakout game he had last week, but he will face a  respectable run defense. Anderson will start against a  Patriots team that has been surprisingly effective against  the run at times. In such a case, we recommend sticking with  the hotter player, and that would be Thomas.

Sometimes, emotions  override matchups. Curtis Martin will always rip holes in  the Miami defense. Lamar Smith will be fired up to face the  Seahawks this week, because he began his career in Seattle.  And in divisional games, big players do well. Don't be  surprised if Eddie George comes up big against Pittsburgh. SPORTING NEWS Subscribe to The Sporting News now for a low $0.99 per issue  AND get a FREE Stainless Steel Thermo-Bottle!

no.address@enron.com,0,0,0.892,50d9b1b1-c470-41c2-a8fb-a871c74fa6bf,"body: Earlier this week, Enron Global Technology announced the plan to decommission the use of all non-standard Internet Email address formats. As mentioned in the previous communication, this was the first of several communications to be sent by the Enron Global Technology group and we will continue to provide more details in the coming weeks regarding this significant but necessary change to our Email environment.   We are working toward a cut-off date of January 14, 2002, at which time we will no longer support Email addresses that do not follow the standard format of firstname.lastname@enron.com (or firstname.middleinitial.lastname@enron.com if your name in Lotus Notes or Outlook has a middle initial in it). We understand that it will take time to make the necessary arrangements to begin using the standard Email address format, but it is important to begin making the change now.   If you have questions, please send an Email to Enron.Messaging.Administration@enron.com.   Thank you for your support.   Enron Global Technology       -----Original Message-----  From: Enron Announcements/Corp/Enron@ENRON on behalf of Enron Messaging Administration  Sent: Mon 10/15/2001 9:15 PM  To: All Enron Worldwide@ENRON  Cc:  Subject: Supported Internet Email Addresses Enron Global Technology is in the process of decommissioning the support for all non-standard Internet Email address formats. The only Internet Email address format that will be supported, once this effort is completed, is firstname.lastname@enron.com. We will no longer support Internet Email address formats such as name@enron.com, name@ect.enron.com, name@ei.enron.com  (where ""name"" is an abbreviation, acronym or alternative to an employees firstname and/or lastname). Every Enron employee has an Internet Email address of firstname.lastname@enron.com and must begin making the necessary arrangements to start using this Internet address format if they are not using it already. Any new/existing application systems or business cards that reference a non-supported Internet Email address will need to be changed to reference the only supported firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet address format. It is important to remember to also notify any external contacts who are currently sending Internet email to any non-supported Internet Email addresses. To determine what your supported Internet Email address is, take your name as it appears in Outlook or Lotus Notes and replace any ""spaces"" that appear in your name with periods and append @enron.com. For example in Outlook, Alan Smith, Robert (firstname = Robert, Lastname = Alan Smith) will have a supported Internet Email address of robert.alan.smith@enron.com. IMPORTANT : If you need to update your business card(s) to reflect your supported Internet Email address, please ensure you test & confirm the delivery of Internet email to your supported email address prior to updating your business cards. If you experience any issues with delivery of Internet email to your supported Internet email address, please contact the Resolution Center. We will communicate further details, including the cut-off date, in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, it is imperative that you begin making the necessary arrangements to change over to using the firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet Email address format. If you have questions regarding this email, send an Email to enron.messaging.administration@enron.com. Thank you for participation, cooperation and support.

bryant@cheatsheets.net,0,0,0.983,d7983099-b736-49ce-85ad-c93ad082a883,"body: Congratulations!   If you're still reading this late in the season,  you're likely in your playoffs (and well on your way to winning your  league...)   We've said all along that it's you guys who make the  site what it is.  We want to show our appreciation and give you guys  some due props.      Beginning Monday, we'll be accepting teams for display on our  Footballguys Wall of Champions.   In this wacky season, making the  playoffs is a feat in itself and we'll be displaying teams that make  their playoffs as well as league winners.   Here's a chance to boast a little and rub it in the faces of your  leaguemates who're on the sidelines watching as you battle for the  league championship.   See the site for details.   Joe and David ******************************************* and now onto the news: Quarterbacks in the News: Rob Johnson (Buf) is out.   Scott Mitchell (Cin) injured himself in Wednesday's practice and is now doubtful for this weekend. Cincinnati has signed Scott Covington.  He will backup Jon Kitna this  week. Gus Frerotte (Den) has been placed on I/R and is out for the rest of  the season.  In related news, the team signed Todd Husak for the  remainder of the season. Mark Brunell (Jac) is expected to practice on Thursday.  He appears  on the injury report as probable with a sore quadriceps.  Daunte Culpepper (Min) underwent surgery and is likely lost for the  season.  Todd Bouman will start in his place.  He is nursing a  sprained ligament in the thumb of his throwing hand, but is expected  to play on Sunday.  Jeff Garcia (SF) was held out of practice on Wednesday and may be  rested this week.  He appears on the injury report as questionable  with sore ribs.  Jeff would like to play, but coach Steve Mariucci is  considering resting Jeff so that he is closer to 100% for the  playoffs.  This would seem to make sense since the Rams have likely  locked up winning the Division.  The 49ers believe they will need a  healthy, scrambling Jeff Garcia to go deep into the post season.  If  Jeff does not play, look for Tim Rattay to get the start.     Steve McNair (Ten), despite being listed on the injury report as  questionable with a sore back is expected to start.   ******************************************* Running Backs in the News: Maurice Smith (Atl) continues to battle through cartilage damage in  his knee.  He is expected to start on Sunday.  He appears on the  injury report as probable. Terry Allen (Bal) will start for the Ravens this week.  Moe Williams  will back him up and see plenty of action.  Jason Brookins (Bal) is out and will not play. Shawn Bryson (Buf) will start this week.  Travis Henry is listed as  out with a bad knee.  Sammy Morris will spell Shawn. James Jackson (Cle) is out this week and is likely going to miss the  remainder of the season with his bad ankle.  Jamel White and Ben Gay  will both see duty in this week's game.

Dear Mr. Cuilla: ""The New Face of Risk: Energy Strategies for a Changed World"" is the theme of CERA's 21st Executive Conference, to be held on February 11-15, 2002 in Houston, Texas.   This event will be particularly timely and important in light of the recent major events transforming the global energy landscape.  I wanted to extend my personal recommendation that you join us in Houston to exchange ideas, interact with peer level senior decision makers, and gain new insight and strategies for the energy future. The full agenda and on-line registration can be found on our website at http://www.cera.com/ceraweek .   As you can see we have a particularly distinguished and exciting group of influential energy leaders speaking at this year's event.  CERAWeek 2002 will offer thought leadership and perspectives on the major new risks and challenges facing energy decision-makers, including the implications of the profound changes that the world has witnessed over the past months.  Among the key topics and questions are: * The new geopolitics -- what are the implications for energy security, global investment, sanctions, and stability? * Markets in turmoil -- what are the prospects for oil, natural gas and electric power prices and asset valuation? * Deregulation -- what will be the responses to the new threats to workable competitive markets?  * Industry structure and competitive dynamics -- How are companies positioning and aligning themselves for the new world? Our focus is on all key regions and energy sectors--oil, natural gas and power.  We have introduced four focused integrated tracks that reflect themes running across the industry.  These include Technology, Finance, Market Strategy, and Environment. The conference is the centerpiece of CERAWeek 2002, a full week of senior level meetings designed to foster exchange and learning, as well as informal interaction and networking.  Last year's participants included some 1700 executives from 47 countries -- including over 400 CEOs, Presidents and Ministers. Two- and Four-day passes are available, as well as enhanced Online Premium digital access to the event.  For the latest agenda updates and special announcements, or to enroll, please visit our website at http://www.cera.com/ceraweek . I look forward to seeing you at CERAWeek 2002.

bryant@cheatsheets.net,0,0,0.981,968c8e72-114e-47be-9790-c9ebdc080a41,"body: Hi Folks, Here's how I see the Passing Game Matchups this week. PLEASE NOTE:   See the cheatsheets online at www.footballguys.com  for exactly where I rank players and to determine who to start.   I always receive emails asking me how I can have a guy ranked highly on the cheatsheet but listed under a matchup that favors the Defense.   Just because one matchup may be more favorable than another, that doesn't necessarily mean I'd start the player with the best matchup.   Peyton Manning may have a horrible matchup one week but unless you're sitting on Kurt Warner or Daunte Culpepper, Manning's your guy no matter who he's lining up against.   The matchup info is meant to be just one more tool in your box when it comes to deciding between players. Note:  I've used the player stats sorted by performance over the last four weeks extensively in developing these write-ups. Stats are provided by Mike Hall's excellent FLM League Management Software.  http://www.fflm.com/ for more info.   The points scored by position data is from ESPN.com. Let's get to it. Joe /**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/ Passing Game Matchups to Avoid and Exploit Locks:  These games feature Defenses that should be overmatched against the Offense. Buffalo Passing Game vs Atlanta Defense Alex Van Pelt threw for 219 yards and 0 TDs with 1 Interception last week. He threw a ton of balls toward Eric Moulds although not many were caught. Peerless Price is also still a prime target.   TE Jay Reimersma and RB Larry Centers will see plenty of short throws.   The Falcons rank # 30 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 30 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 30 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs so they've pretty much been weak all year defending the pass. Dallas Passing Game vs Arizona Defense It'll be hard to imagine Quincy Carter leading many FF teams to Playoff victories this week.   If you've got to go with one, Joey Galloway suddenly become Carter's favorite target last week.  Go figure.   Just when you thought he was locking on Rocket Ismail.   Both guys are risks.   Even with Arizona ranked # 27 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 27 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 27 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.   Great matchup, but I just don't have a lot of faith in these guys being able to take advantage of it. Oakland Passing Game vs Tennessee Defense Yes, Brett Favre and the Packers didn't do much against the Titans last week.   But in my opinion, you just can't bench Rich Gannon, Jerry Rice or Tim Brown.   They're just too good and are too liable to explode at any time.   The Titans rank # 29 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks so clearly, people are throwing on them.   For the year, they rank # 29 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 31 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.   Start your Raiders. Pittsburgh Passing Game vs Detroit Defense Hard to imagine but Kordell Stewart is carrying Fantasy Teams right now. He's been awesome and isn't showing any signs that I can see of letting up. The one factor he'd been missing, he now seems to have in abundance - Confidence.   Hines Ward wasn't a big factor receiving but he's a great bet. Plaxico Burress made the circus catch and looks to be quickly rising in the charts.   The Lions are fired up but still rank # 20 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 31 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 28 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs. St. Louis Passing Game vs Carolina Defense Start your Rams.   Warner, Bruce and Holt are sure starters.   Yes, it's tough to guess which Ram WR will do well as Warner spreads the ball around. But I don't see how you can have either of these guys benched as you could leave a ton of points on the table.   Carolina ranks # 23 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 28 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 22 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs. /**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/ Prime Matchups:  These games feature Defenses that should have trouble stopping the Offense. Cleveland Passing Game vs Green Bay Defense Tim Couch evidently had been catching a lot of flak from Browns fans for not being a very accurate passer last week.   Seeing as how not one of the 20,000 bottles thrown on the field actually hit a player or ref, I'd guess the fans might want to keep their day jobs...   Couch wasn't very effective last week with 184 yards, 0 TDs and 1 Interception.   Normally reliable WR Kevin Johnson came up small as well.   I still have faith in Johnson as he's shown too much this year to discount him over one game.   The Packers rank # 22 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 12 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 5 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs. Kansas City Passing Game vs San Diego Defense Trent Green's finally coming around.   Either that, or he's just teasing us...   With the dominant running of Priest Holmes, Green is finding room to throw.   Marvin Minnis and Derrick Alexander are doing well.   Tony Gonzalez isn't as involved as his owners would like but he's a sure starter in TE leagues.   The Chargers rank # 18 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 21 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 15 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs. Minnesota Passing Game vs Jacksonville Defense The hits just keep rolling for Minnesota.   QB Todd Bouman's thumb is causing serious worry.   Enough that there's talk that Spergon Wynn could get the start.   Stay tuned on this one.   Randy Moss has clearly decided to play lately and will wind up with season long stats that'll make all the non Moss owners wonder what all the Moss guys were complaining about early on. Cris Carter is definitely taking a backseat to Moss lately.   The Jaguars rank # 26 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 18 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 8 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs. New York Jets Passing Game vs Indianapolis Defense The Jets are tough to call lately.   Testeverde threw for 196 yards and did manage 2 TDs.   But Laveranues Coles didn't do a lot.   (Although Chris Berman's call of ""Laveranues Coles 'shopping' for 18 yards"" was classic on the Prime Time highlights...)   Wayne Chrebet was more active and of course Anthony Becht caught the TD but not much else.   All in all, a risky place for FF passing game material.   Curtis Martin should run wild on this bunch. The Colts rank # 21 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 26 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 26 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs. Philadelphia Passing Game vs San Francisco Defense The passing game lately has been Donovan McNabb throwing to Duce Staley. That's ok as long as they get the yards.   Todd Pinkston and James Thrash have been inconsistent.   They'll face a 49er team that's been pretty soft lately ranking # 24 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 15 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 19 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs. Tennessee Passing Game vs Oakland Defense I never thought I'd be writing about the pass happy Titans but that's the case.   Steve McNair has been awesome lately and ranks as the # 2 QB in the league over the last 3 games.   Derrick Mason and Kevin Dyson are starters in just about every league.   TE Frank Wycheck is producing like always. The Raiders rank # 19 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 11 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 12 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs. /**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/ Even Matchups:  These games feature no real advantage either way Atlanta Passing Game vs Buffalo Defense It's tough to depend on Chris Chandler but last week he played very well throwing for 249 yards and 2 TDs.   Tony Martin seems to be coming on a bit. We said we loved Brian Finneran and he scored.   He's not on the field enough (yet) to be a solid starter but he makes things happen out there. RB Bob Christian is an integral part of the passing game as well.   This week, they'll face a Buffalo defense ranked # 13 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 24 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 17 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs. Baltimore Passing Game vs Cincinnati Defense Elvis Grbac managed 2 TDs with just 159 yards Sunday night.   Picking a receiver for the Ravens is as tough as ever with Ismail / Stokely / Taylor all in the mix.   TE Shannon Sharpe is the sure bet.   This week, they'll face the Bengals ranked # 10 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 19 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 23 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.   Terry Allen should be more of a factor in this one as well. Green Bay Passing Game vs Cleveland Defense I can't imagine benching Brett Favre right now.   He seems to get better as it gets colder and they have a lot riding on these next few games after losing to Tennessee Sunday.   Antonio Freeman and Billy Schroeder both should be ready to play.   The Browns have been tough lately ranking # 8 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 3 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 18 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs. Jacksonville Passing Game vs Minnesota Defense Mark Brunell posted 202 yards , 1 TD and 2 Interceptions Sunday.   Keenan McCardell and Jimmy Smith were as active as usual.   They're two of the steadiest guys in the league.   It's surprising, but Minnesota's been tough lately against the pass ranking # 7 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 22 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 21 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs. Miami Passing Game vs New England Defense The problem with Jay Fiedler is that when he's ugly, he's really ugly.   If you started him Sunday, you know what I mean.   149 yards, 0 TDs and 3 Interceptions wont win Real or Fantasy Games for anyone.   Oronde Gadsden was injured to boot.   Gasden said he'll be ready Sunday.   Chris Chambers still has tons of upside if you're ready to roll the dice.   New England ranks # 25 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 16 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 13 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs. San Diego Passing Game vs Kansas City Defense Doug Flutie threw 3 Interceptions Sunday with 0 TDs.   Another day like that and he'll see Drew Brees finishing the game.   You might see Brees anyway as they'll want to start taking a look at their QB of the future.   Jeff Graham and Curtis Conway continue to play well.  Tim Dwight could miss another game due to his lung problem.   TE Freddie Jones is inconsistent but if you own him, he's probably a starter for you.   Kansas City ranks # 16 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 14 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 11 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs. Seattle Passing Game vs New York Giants Defense With 152 yards, 0 Interceptions and 0 TDs, you can say at least Hasselbeck didn't do anything to hurt the Seahawks.   Darrell Jackson is the clear # 1 guy although Koren Robinson will see his share of passes.   The Giants rank # 14 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 17 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 29 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs. Tampa Bay Passing Game vs New Orleans Defense Johnson threw an ugly game last week with 191 yards, 0 TDs and 2 Interceptions.   If a team finds a way to limit Keyshawn Johnson, the passing game is gone.   Granted, most teams have trouble keeping Keyshawn from getting his catches, but the over reliance on one receiver severely restricts the offense in my opinion.   Warrick Dunn saw plenty of passes Sunday but it wasn't enough.   At this point, Keyshawn is the only consistent starter in this passing game.   New Orleans ranks # 17 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks after the St. Louis game Monday night.   For the year, they rank # 25 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 24 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs. /**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/ Downside Matchups:  These games feature a Defense that could pose trouble for the Offense. Carolina Passing Game vs St. Louis Defense Surely, you're not down to Chris Weinke are you?   Even with a week to rest, I'm not excited about their prospects.   Muhsin Muhammad might be an option for some teams.   TE Wesley Walls just doesn't seem to consistently get on the same page as Weinke.   The Rams rank # 9 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 13 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 7 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs. Cincinnati Passing Game vs Baltimore Defense Don't even go there.   Maybe Peter Warrick in a stretch if you're desperate but that's pretty much it.   This team is all about Corey Dillon. Unfortunately, the Ravens picked up on that as well.   They rank # 31 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks with 811 passing yards allowed in 3 games.   For the year, they rank # 20 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 20 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.   Even so, I'd still avoid. Detroit Passing Game vs Pittsburgh Defense Mike McMahon led the Lions to the feel good story of the week Sunday as they beat the Vikings.   Hats off to them and their fans.   They kept playing hard.   Mike McMahon looked very good and definitely showed some flashes of talent with his scrambling ability.   He threw for 241 yards with 0 TDs but also 0 Interceptions.   Johnnie Morton is the clear cut # 1 Guy but Scottie Anderson did well too.   The Steelers rank # 28 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks primarily because nobody can run on them. For the year, they rank # 4 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 10 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs. New Orleans Passing Game vs Tampa Bay Defense Start Aaron Brooks.   Like you need me to tell you that.   Joe Horn and probably Willie Jackson are starters in your league as well.   Looks like Cam Cleeland has taken over all of the work Boo Williams was seeing at TE. These guys are hot.   Ricky Williams reportedly has a hairline fracture in one of his ribs but is expected to play.   You have to think this will at least throw a little more focus on the passing game though.   The Bucs rank # 5 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks so they're tough.   For the year, they rank # 7 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 6 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs. New York Giants Passing Game vs Seattle Defense Collins has been up and down.   He did have 2 TDs last week but only threw for 147 yards.   Amani Toomer was the clear # 1 Guy with Ike Hilliard apparently hurting.   Ron Dixon got into the action with a TD but he's inconsistent.   The Seahawks rank a very solid # 3 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 23 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 9 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs. San Francisco Passing Game vs Philadelphia Defense The 49ers showed Sunday they can win in different ways as they rode the legs of Garrison Hearst and the RB corps to victory.   Jeff Garcia did very little throwing for 133 yards and a TD.   He'll likely be needed more this week.   Terrell Owens is still his clear cut go to guy.   Garcia could make the Eagles pay with their blitz happy defense.   Philadelphia ranks # 12 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 2 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 2 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs. Washington Passing Game vs Chicago Defense Tony Banks struggled last week throwing for 213 yards, 0 TDs and 2 Interceptions.   His WR corps of Westbrook and Gardner have been ok but not great lately.   TE Zeron Flemister did see several passes thrown his way again.   He's worth a shot if you're in need of a TE.   The Bears have improved lately against the pass ranking # 11 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 10 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 1 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs. /**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/ Defensive Slam Dunks:  These games feature a very tough Defense posing major problems for the Offense. Arizona Passing Game vs Dallas Defense Jake Plummer played decent last week with 207 yards and 1 TD.   David Boston is a must start at WR.   For you guys desperate for a TE, look at Twayn Mitchell who had 7 catches for 62 yards a TD.   You could do a lot worse. We'll see if he can keep that up.   The Cowboys rank # 1 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 5 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 4 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs so this will be no cakewalk. Chicago Passing Game vs Washington Defense Jim Miller isn't carrying anyone's FF Team lately.   Although his 190 yards and 2 TDs Sunday weren't bad.   Marty Booker is still seeing a ton of balls thrown his way.   And Dez White is seeing action.   David Terrell makes the most of what he gets but he's not seeing a lot of passes.   This team is about Anthony Thomas and smashmouth football.   They'll have occasional outbursts of big plays but primarily, it's Thomas.   The Redskins have been very good lately ranking # 2 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 9 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 14 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs. Indianapolis Passing Game vs New York Jets Defense We got the predicted bounceback from Manning as he threw for 325 yards and 3 TDs with 1 Interception.   He's been up and down so let's see if he can keep it up.   Of course Marvin Harrison is the prime target but rookie Reggie Wayne's seeing lots of passes too.   TE Marcus Pollard was very involved in the game plan last week as well.   The Jets rank # 4 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 1 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 3 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs. Tough matchup. New England Passing Game vs Miami Defense Tom Brady continues his slide back to Earth.   He threw for 237 yards, 0 TDs and 1 Interception last week.   But the Patriots won and that's all they care about.   Troy Brown is being hurt by Terry Glenn's return.   Brown, Glenn and David Patten all seem to be seeing fairly equal number of opportunities.   The Dolphins are tough against the pass ranking # 6 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 6 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 16 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs. /**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/ Bryant Analytics, Inc.

Live draft in Las Vegas at the MGM Grand Casino. (Where else?) My friends at Fantasy Sports Publications and Draftsharks.com are putting it on and I gotta say I think it's going to be very cool. If you're interested in competing in the 2002 World Championship of Fantasy Football, check out http://www.wcoff.com. Because you're a Footballguys.com subscriber, I wanted to give you an early headsup for this exciting opportunity. I talked to Emil Kadlec at Fantasy Sports Publications and they've already taken over 300 applications for the 504 slots. So don't wait too long. Hopefully, I'll see you in Las Vegas. Joe /**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/ Hi Folks, Doing our best to get these to you early in the week as you juggle your lineups for the stretch run.   Here's how I see the Rushing Game Matchups this week. PLEASE NOTE:   See the cheatsheet online www.footballguys.com for exactly where I rank players and to determine who to start.   I always receive emails asking me how I can have a guy ranked highly on the cheatsheet but listed under a matchup that favors the Defense.   Just because one matchup may be more favorable than another, that doesn't necessarily mean I'd start the player with the best matchup.   Ahman Green may have a horrible matchup one week but unless you're sitting on Ricky Williams or Marshall Faulk, Green's your guy no matter who he's lining up against.  (Yes, even after last week's performance)  The matchup info is meant to be just one more tool in your box when it comes to deciding between players. Stats are provided by Mike Hall's excellent FLM League Management Software. http://www.fflm.com/ for more info.   Fantasy Points Allowed by position numbers are from ESPN.com.   Target numbers are from our Footballguy Andy Hicks. Let's get to it. /**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/ Locks:  These games feature Defenses that should be overmatched against the Offense. Jacksonville's Stacey Mack vs Minnesota Defense Stacey Mack played well last week rushing for 115 yards on 28 carries (4.1 ypc).   He's settling into the starting RB role pretty well.   Still very quiet on the Fred Taylor front so you have to assume Mack's going to keep his job.   With no playoff hopes, it probably makes sense not to rush Taylor back.   Mack will face an ultra soft Viking defense this week ranked # 31 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 30 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs. New York Jet's Curtis Martin vs Indianapolis Defense Curtis Martin ran hard last week.   He had 78 yards on 24 carries (3.2 ypc) plus he caught a couple of passes.   This might be his week though as the Colts are weak on defense ranking # 28 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 31 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.   If he's going to explode, this is the week. St. Louis' Marshall Faulk vs Carolina Defense Start Faulk.   End of story.   He's the best player in Fantasy Football. If it matters (and it doesn't) the Panthers rank # 24 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks and # 29 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.   Faulk's knee was described as ""puffy"" after the game but he insists he'll be fine and play.   Although some are saying Trung Canidate will see increased time.   He's still a must start in my opinion though. Tennessee's Eddie George / Skip Hicks vs Oakland Defense This one hurts.   Eddie George owners have been circling on their calendars the Oakland game with their porous rush defense.   And then Skip Hicks comes in last week and looks like Earl Campbell rushing for 142 yards on 17 carries (8.4 ypc) and a score   (Granted, those numbers are padded with a 51 yard rush)   George is such a team player that he reportedly didn't mind Hicks staying in the game as he had the hot hand.   I think you'll see George back this week in his regular role but Hicks could get the call at any time.   The Raiders have improved on defense.   Now they just rank # 30 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 24 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs. /**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/ Prime Matchups:  These games feature Defenses that should have trouble stopping the Offense. Atlanta's Maurice Smith / Bob Christian vs Buffalo Defense Maurice looked a little better (or healthier) this week but he's still underperforming.   He rushed 11 times for 49 yards (4.5 ypc) Sunday.   Bob Christian is clearly going to be more involved at RB.   He had 7 rushes for 17 yards (2.4 ypc) and a score.   Christian also tacked on 66 yards receiving.   At this point, I'd say Christian deserves a look in larger leagues.   The Bill Defense is pretty weak ranking # 27 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 28 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs. Chicago's Anthony Thomas vs Washington Defense With 31 carries last week for 173 yards (5.6 ypc), I think it's safe to say Thomas is back.   He's a perfect fit for this conservative offense.   Plus the Bear's defense looks like it'll keep them in most games which keeps Thomas involved.   He'll face a Redskin defense that ranks # 19 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks and # 26 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs. Green Bay's Ahman Green vs Cleveland Defense It's my opinion that Ahman Green owners should just forget about last week. Green was held to just 9 yards on 9 carries by a surging Tennessee defense. I see very little to make me think this wasn't an aberration.   This week, he'll face a softer Brown defense that's ranked # 14 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, Cleveland is ranked # 20 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.   Fantasy Football owners traditionally have memories that last about 7 days.   I personally am not letting last weeks performance wipe out what has been a great year. Indianapolis' Dominic Rhodes vs New York Jets Defense It's too early to be talking about Edgerrin James being a product of the ""system"" but the truth of the matter is that no name Dominic Rhodes is tearing it up lately.   He's had 298 rushing yards over the last 3 games. Sunday, he rolled for 177 of them on 29 carries (6.1 ypc)   (and his longest run was 35 yards so it's not like he padded the stats with a 80 yarder)   He caught 3 passes to boot.   Clearly, he's playing at a high level right now and is a must start in most leagues.   The Jets were horrible early on against the run but have now improved to average ranking # 17 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 25 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs. New England's Antowain Smith vs Miami Defense You know Antowain Smith had fun against his old team Sunday when he rolled up 95 yards on 20 carries (4.8 ypc)   He continues to be one of the better stories of 2001.   Over the last 3 weeks, he ranks as the # 8 RB in Fantasy points per game.   Smith should have had a TD but went down at the 2.   This week, he'll face a Dolphin Defense that's been soft lately.   They rank # 26 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 11 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs. New Orleans' Ricky Williams / Deuce McAllister vs Tampa Bay Defense Williams had a sub par game Monday night and it does seem like Coach Jim Haslett has been looking the other way the last few games.   He only had 14 carries Monday.   He did gain 57 yards (4.1 ypc) so he did well when he was in there.   Some of that can be attributed to the Rams and their offense taking Williams out.   Although you can't ignore Deuce McAllister. McAllister had 5 catches for 44 yards (but just one carry)   The Bucs are nothing special lately ranking # 21 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 15 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.   Keep an eye on Tampa's Warren Sapp who missed a good bit of time last week with a shoulder injury.   It'd be a nice boost if he's less than 100%. New York Giants' Tiki Barber / Ron Dayne vs Seattle Defense Barber continues to steal the show from Ron Dayne.   Barber rushed 16 times for 85 yards (5.3 ypc)   Dayne only had 4 carries for 9 yards.   Barber was also the Giant's leading receiver with 5 receptions.   I don't see that changing a lot.   Seattle is ranked # 29 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 13 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs. San Francisco's Garrison Hearst vs Philadelphia Defense Garrison Hearst continues to be one of the best stories in the league.   He ran for 103 yards on 26 carries Sunday (4.0 ypc)   You have to be a little worried about him though as Kevan Barlow got both rushing TDs.   And both Terry Jackson and Fred Beasley saw red zone carries.   Hearst will be a guy who runs up and down the field but it looks like coach Steve Mariucci has more faith in the other guys for the goalline.   The Eagles rank # 23 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 10 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs. /**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/ Even Matchups:  These games feature no real advantage either way Arizona's Michael Pittman / Thomas Jones vs Dallas Defense Things are looking pretty bad for Michael Pittman owners.   As we commented earlier, the carries allotted to Jones have been creeping up.   Last week, it looked more like a full blown time share with Pittman running 14 times for 37 yards (2.6 ypc) and Jones totaling 24 yards on 12 carries (2.0 ypc) Clearly, neither are any good but that's bad news for Pittman owners.   Of even more concern is the fact that Jones is looking like the short yardage / red zone guy.   The Cowboys rank # 25 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 14 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.   It's tough right now to put much faith in either guy though, even with the favorable matchup. Buffalo's Shawn Bryson vs Atlanta Defense Travis Henry's tough rookie year continued Sunday as he injured his knee. Shawn Bryson will likely get the bulk of the work this week.   Bryson didn't do much Sunday running 14 times for 38 yards (2.7 ypc)   He did catch 3 passes.   He'll likely be better with a week of practice with the first unit.   The Falcons haven't been anything special against the run lately ranking # 22 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks and # 21 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs for the year. Dallas' Emmitt Smith vs Arizona Defense Emmitt Smith looked like the ""old"" Emmitt Smith.  ""Old"" as in 2001 version which means not very good.   He struggled to get 39 yards on 12 carries (3.2 ypc) and generally wasn't a factor.   He's an up and down player so realize your taking a chance with him.   The Cardinals aren't much on defense ranking # 20 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks. For the year, they rank # 23 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs. Miami's Lamar Smith vs New England Defense Lamar Smith is a grinder type back that needs lots of carries to be effective.   He only rushed 9 times Sunday for 22 yards (2.4 ypc)   That won't get it done.   Travis Minor is a threat but it looks to me like the Dolphins will stay with Smith for now.   New England ranks # 13 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 16 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs. Pittsburgh's Chris Fuamatu-Ma'afala / Jerome Bettis / Amos Zereoue vs Detroit Defense Amos Zereoue had a pretty good game against Baltimore with 73 yards on 16 carries (4.6 ypc)   But he hurt his shoulder and is now questionable for this week's game.   Fuamatu-Ma'afala ran hard but had little room to move gaining 15 yards on 9 carries (1.7 ypc)   And finally, Jerome Bettis is in the mix although the early word has him as doubtful again for this week's game.   Obviously, they're being very careful to preserve him for the playoffs.   We'll try to stay on this story this week for you.   The Lions are surprisingly tough against the run lately ranking # 11 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 22 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs. San Diego's LaDainian Tomlinson vs Kansas City Defense Tomlinson struggled a bit last week with just 46 yards on 17 carries (2.7 ypc)   He did add 23 yards on 6 catches.   He'll face an improved KC defense this week ranked # 8 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 27 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs. Seattle's Shaun Alexander vs New York Giants Defense It's been an up and down last couple of weeks for Alexander owners but with Ricky Watters broken ankle, Alexander is back in the saddle as the # 1 Guy. Look for him to pick up where he left off.   Last week, he rushed for 27 yards on 7 carries (3.9 ypc) plus a TD.   The Giants have been pretty average lately in stopping the run ranking # 15 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 2 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs. Washington's Stephen Davis vs Chicago Defense Stephen Davis played well last week with 111 yards on 24 carries (4.6 ypc) He was one of the few bright spots for Washington.   This week, he faces a tough but beatable Bear defense that ranks # 16 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 9 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs. /**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/ Downside Matchups:  These games feature a Defense that could pose trouble for the Offense. Baltimore's Moe Williams / Terry Allen vs Cincinnati Defense You know it's not good when Obafemi Ayanbadejo leads the team in rushing yards and Elvis Grbac leads the team in rushing TDs.   But that's what happened Sunday against the Steelers.  ( I wonder if Ray Lewis thinks the Steelers have a ""real defense"" yet?)   Moe Williams logged 15 yards on 4 carries (3.8 ypc) and Terry Allen made a less than smashing debut with 3 yards on 3 carries (you do the math)   Tough to say how it'll be split this week but you'd have to think Allen will see more time.   The Bengals aren't as good as Pittsburgh, but they're very good ranking # 4 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 4 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.   Tough matchup especially since it's not yet clear how the carries will be split. Cleveland's James Jackson / Jamel White vs Green Bay Defense Watch this one closely this week as Jackson tweaked his troublesome ankle again.   He could be ok, but it's not clear early this week.   If he can't go, I'd expect you'll see Jamel White over Ben Gay as Gay has made more than his share of mistakes.   Whoever runs will be facing the suddenly vulnerable Packers who rank # 18 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 8 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs. Kansas City's Priest Holmes / Tony Richardson vs San Diego Defense We had Holmes ranked # 5 last week.  I'm guessing you'll see more sites follow our lead and raise him up the charts as well.   He had a monster game (again) with 121 yards on 29 carries (4.2 ypc) plus the score.   He's a must start against pretty much any defense.   This week, he'll face a San Diego team ranked # 6 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks. For the year, they rank # 7 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.   Still though, I wouldn't let that stop me.   Do keep an eye on his health this week as he's nursing a sore groin that might limit him. Minnesota's Michael Bennett vs Jacksonville Defense Outside of Indianapolis, I don't know that there's been a more disappointing than Minnesota.   Or one tougher to predict each week.   You get fired up on Michael Bennett and then he cools off.   Last week, he was back to his early season workload with only 10 carries.   He did gain 40 yards (4.0 ypc) so when he ran, he did fine.   With him, it's a numbers game.   Give him enough carries and eventually he'll break one.   But 10 opportunities won't do it. And he'll face a very tough Jacksonville defense that's been hot lately. They rank # 2 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks. For the year, they rank # 12 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs. Oakland's Charlie Garner vs Tennessee Defense Charlie Garner had his usual productive day with 68 yards rushing on 19 carries (3.6 ypc) plus another 45 yards receiving.   The big news was Tyrone Wheatley not getting a carry.   Looks like Zack Crockett is back in at the goalline.   Although that can change at any moment.   The Titans shut down Ahman Green last week so that's a worry.   They rank # 9 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 17 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs. Philadelphia's Duce Staley vs San Francisco Defense Staley continues to salvage his rushing numbers with his contributions in the passing game.   He rushed 15 times for 36 yards Sunday (2.4 ypc)   He also had 2 fumbles.   But on the bright side, he caught 8 passes for 73 yards.   They'll find the going a little tougher this week against San Francisco ranked # 5 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 19 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs. Tampa Bay's Warrick Dunn / Mike Alstott vs New Orleans Defense You'll go crazy trying to figure out which one of these guys will do anything week to week.   Dunn only had 10 carries for 27 yards (2.7 ypc) and Alstott only managed 7 rushes for 23 yards (3.3 ypc)   Dunn was heavily involved in the Tampa Dink and Dunk passing game but that's tough to count on.   They'll face a New Orleans defense that's likely smarting from the Rams defeat.   They rank # 7 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 18 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs. /**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/ Defensive Slam Dunks:  These games feature a very tough Defense posing major problems for the Offense. Carolina's Richard Huntley vs St. Louis Defense Huntley should be rested after the bye week.   Unfortunately, rest won't make him any more talented.   The Rams rank # 10 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks and # 5 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs so this isn't looking good. Cincinnati's Corey Dillon vs Baltimore Defense It's strength against strength this week with Dillon facing the Ravens.   If you can imagine it, the Bengals will be hurting without Akili Smith at QB... That means Dillon is the whole offense and you can bet the Ravens will be geared up for it.   On a forward looking note, it doesn't get any easier for Dillon as he has Tennessee and Pittsburgh on the horizon.   If your trade deadline hasn't passed, I'd consider dealing him.   The Ravens rank # 12 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks but I think they're better than that.   They rank # 3 for the year in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs. Detroit's James Stewart vs Pittsburgh Defense James Stewart's hip injury may not be as bad as feared.   He had a solid game in their first victory last week rushing for 91 yards on 20 carries (4.6 ypc)   The awful news this week is that he's playing Pittsburgh.   The Steelers are dominating offenses right now ranking # 1 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 1 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs. /**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/ That'll do it for the Rushing Matchups.   Passing Matchups to follow.

bryant@cheatsheets.net,0,0,0.993,1f5f3961-d53f-4732-9916-8ea2023d7180,"body: Entire story: http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/tribune-review/sports/steelerslive/s_9838.ht ml From the Jerry DiPaola article:   Steelers running back Jerome Bettis missed practice Wednesday, and later said he might not need to play in the final two regular-season games to be ready for the first playoff game Jan. 19 or 20. Bettis has missed the past three games with a serious groin injury that he described to David Letterman last week as ""like splitting your pants, but you're splitting your body."" ""Do you need to (play)? Need is a strong word,"" Bettis said yesterday after watching his teammates practice. ""Would you like to get a little work in? Just a little bit, nothing strenuous. But you would like to get a little work in if you could. ""But if you can't, I don't think it precludes you from playing (in the playoffs)."" Bettis said that he didn't know if he would practice today or play Sunday in Cincinnati, but he will base his availability on how he feels. ""You want to take care of the injury first and if that means not playing, that means not playing,"" he said. ""But you want to make sure you're healed up. The team playing as well as it has played allows me the opportunity to get healthy. I'm using it very, very wisely. ""What I do know is if you don't play, there is going to be a certain amount of rust associated with not having played. The key is to minimize the rust. This is nine years in. I'm not going to miss much."" ************  Our View  **************** Pretty much sums it up right there.   Clearly, Bettis is a large risk here. Stay tuned to see how he progresses but even if he were to start, there's always that very real risk that he'd pull himself out if he felt a twinge. Thanks to Footballguy Greg Lizotte for pointing me to this one. Joe /**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/ Bryant Analytics, Inc.

Best of luck to everyone that is playing  for their Championship this week. *********************************************************** Quarterbacks in the News: Rob Johnson (Buf) is out this week with a bruised shoulder and ego.   Alex Van Pelt will again start in his place. Scott Mitchell (Cin) is doubtful this week.  He is not expected to  play.  Jon Kitna will start as usual. Mike McMahon (Det) is still wearing the protective boot and has not  practiced all week.  He is unlikely to play.  Ty Detmer will start if  McMahon cannot go. McMahon appears on the injury report as  questionable with a sore foot. *** Saturday Morning Update ? Mike McMahon (Det) was downgraded to doubtful after failing to practice this week.  Ty Detmer is  expected to start. Mark Brunell (Jac) practiced on Wednesday and Thursday and is  expected to start on Sunday.  He appears on the injury report as  probable with a sore quadriceps. Jay Fiedler (Mia) appears on the Friday injury report as probable  with a sore elbow.  He is expected to start as usual. Todd Bouman (Min) practiced, but was not effective and appears much  worse than his probable status on the injury report.  Spergon Wynn  practiced both Wednesday and Thursday with the first unit and will  likely start. *** Saturday Morning Update ? Spergon Wynn (Min) has been named the starter.

Martin Gramatica (TB) was not able to practice on Thursday, but is  recovering quickly.  The team is not likely to make  a decision on  who will kick until right before kickoff.

PLEASE NOTE:   See the cheatsheets online at www.footballguys.com  for exactly where I rank players and to determine who to start.   I always receive emails asking me how I can have a guy ranked highly on the cheatsheet but listed under a matchup that favors the Defense.   Just because one matchup may be more favorable than another, that doesn't necessarily mean I'd start the player with the best matchup.   Jeff Garcia may have a horrible matchup one week but unless you're sitting on Kurt Warner or Brett Favre, Garcia's your guy no matter who he's lining up against.   The matchup info is meant to be just one more tool in your box when it comes to deciding between players. Note:  I've used the player stats sorted by performance over the last four weeks extensively in developing these write-ups.

Joe /**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/ Passing Game Matchups to Avoid and Exploit /**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/ Locks:  These games feature Defenses that have struggled lately. Arizona Passing Game vs Carolina Defense Jake Plummer came up small last week with just 144 yards against a hot Dallas pass Defense.   Surprisingly, David Boston was a non factor with just 26 yards.   Although he still had a ton of balls thrown his way so there's nothing to worry about.   Carolina ranks # 30 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 28 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 22 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs. Cleveland Passing Game vs Tennessee Defense Tim Couch threw for 203 yards and a TD last week against Green Bay which was the 12th best day among QBs last week ahead of guys like Manning, McNair and Garcia.   Clearly, the matchup helped him out.   Kevin Johnson, as usual, was his primary target although it was good to see RB Jamel White involved in the passing game with lots of passes thrown his way.   The Titans have been awful lately against the pass ranking # 29 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 30 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 31 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.   Again, some people have a hard time understanding what these matchups provide - I'm not saying Couch will have a great game.   Check the cheatsheet rankings for where we have him.   What I'm saying is that he has a great matchup here against the Titans who've struggled against the pass all year. Miami Passing Game vs Atlanta Defense Jay Fiedler exploded for 320 yards and a TD last week.   Finally, Footballguy Favorite Chris Chambers got a start and delivered big time with 124 yards on 7 receptions.   He did tweak an ankle but is expected to be ok this week.   TE Jed Weaver also saw lots of passes thrown his way.   The Falcons rank # 31 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 29 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 30 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs. New York Jets Passing Game vs Buffalo Defense Vinny Testeverde refuses to fade away.   He rolled up 285 yards and 2 TDs (with 2 Interceptions) against Indy Sunday.   Wayne Chrebet was the primary WR with Laveranues Coles seeing less action.   TE Anthony Becht produced another TD.   The Bills rank # 27 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 24 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 20 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs. St. Louis Passing Game vs Indianapolis Defense Kurt Warner had an ""off"" day for him with ""just"" 217 yards and 2 TDs.   Of course, he's a must start every week.   The trouble with him is he spreads the ball around so well, it's tough to predict which WR will see action but I'd have a very hard time benching guys like Holt, Bruce or even Proehl. Keep an eye on the thumb he tweaked but he's saying he's ok.   The Colts rank # 28 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 27 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 27 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs. /**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/ Prime Matchups:  These games feature Defenses that haven't been strong lately. Chicago Passing Game vs Detroit Defense Marty Booker catching 74 yards worth of passes isn't as remarkable until you realize QB Jim Miller only threw for 98 yards.   I guess that makes Booker the # 1 WR...   He's clearly the favored option.   This team is all about Anthony Thomas and their defense though so I'm not too excited about any of these guys outside of Booker even with the matchup.   The Lions rank # 22 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 31 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 29 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs. Green Bay Passing Game vs Minnesota Defense Brett Favre made the most out of 139 yards throwing for 3 TDs last week. He's too good to sit against anyone.   Antonio Freeman and Billy Schroeder are solid options and Bubba Franks seems to have picked up where he was earlier this year.   The Vikings rank # 17 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 21 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 24 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs. Indianapolis Passing Game vs St. Louis Defense Manning was back on track again with 228 yards, 1 TD and 0 Interceptions last week.   The interceptions have hurt him this year but the fact is he's still one of the leagues best QBs.   Marvin Harrison was incredible catching nearly everything in his sight.   The Rams rank # 24 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.  Remember, Chris Weinke rolled over them last week.   For the year, they rank # 15 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 8 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs. Oakland Passing Game vs Denver Passing Game It's funny when people get excited about Gannon throwing just 249 yards but that's what's happening.   He's spoiled us.   I'm not worried about him as along with Jerry Rice and Tim Brown, they're still one of the better passing units in the game.   Charlie Garner is a nice target too.   This week, they'll face a suddenly vulnerable Denver team that ranks # 23 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 9 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 25 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs. Tampa Bay Passing Game vs Baltimore Defense Brad Johnson put together a great game with 3 TDs and 0 Interceptions on 207 yards.   Keyshawn Johnson is of course the receiver of choice and outside of him, I don't see many other viable FF options.   Johnson to Johnson is the name of this passing game.   Baltimore ranks # 26 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 17 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 19 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs. /**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/ Even Matchups:  These games feature no real advantage either way Carolina Passing Game vs Arizona Defense Weinke's 312 yard day last week against the Rams was surprising as the Rams were ranked as the # 9 passing defense over the last 4 weeks going into last week.   Donald Hayes was ultra active and may need to be again this week as Muhsin Muhammad is very iffy and TE Wesley Walls tweaked his knee.   The Cardinals rank # 14 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 26 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 26 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs. Denver Passing Game vs Oakland Defense Brian Griese should be back and ready to go.   Gus Frerotte is out for the year so Jarius Jackson will be the # 2 guy.   Rod Smith is the only receiver of note and he's a guy you can never count out.   The bye week helped and he's reportedly feeling better than he has in a while.   Oakland has struggled lately on defense ranking # 21 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 10 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 13 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs. Jacksonville Passing Game vs Kansas City Defense Brunell had a Brunell-like day last week with 217 yards and a TD.   Jimmy Smith is a must start and Keenan McCardell deserves a hard look in just about any league.   The Chiefs rank # 18 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 14 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 12 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs. Kansas City Passing Game vs Jacksonville Defense Trent Green put together a decent day with 203 yards, 1 TD and 2 Interceptions.   Snoop Minnis was the preferred WR while Derrick Alexander did very little.   Tony Gonzalez was fairly involved although not as much as his owners would like to see.   He's still a must start for TE leagues. The Jaguars rank # 20 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 19 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 6 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs. Minnesota Passing Game vs Green Bay Defense Stay tuned this week for whether Todd Bouman or Spergon Wynn gets the call. The Vikings have imploded.   If Bouman starts, it's much better news for Moss.   If Wynn starts, Cris Carter seemed to be the favored target. Although it was pretty clear that they were forcing the ball to Carter because it could've been his last game in Minnesota.   Honestly, it's tough to sit Cris Carter or Randy Moss regardless of who is at QB.   WRs are rarely a sure thing.   The Packers rank # 19 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 12 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 5 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs. Philadelphia Passing Game vs New York Giants Defense The Eagle passing game is all about McNabb to RB Duce Staley now.   Good for Staley owners but not the ideal situation for McNabb.   James Thrash and Freddie Mitchell saw most of the action at WR but they weren't too effective.   Todd Pinkston is in the mix which makes it even tougher to pick a WR.   The Giants may be without Jason Sehorn this week which would be big. They rank # 6 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks. For the year, they rank # 18 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 28 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs. Pittsburgh Passing Game vs Cincinnati Defense Kordell Stewart continues to prove his critics wrong as he rolled up 3 TDs last week and 221 yards.   There's serious MVP talk about him and deservedly so.   WRs Hines Ward and Plaxico Burress both deserve a look for most any team.   Burress, in particular, is coming on lately.   The Bengals are tougher than many realize against the pass lately.   They rank # 7 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 16 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 21 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs. San Diego Passing Game vs Seattle Defense Doug Flutie was awful early, but made a great recovery to finish with 175 yards and 2 TDs with no Interceptions.   There's a lot of talk about letting Drew Brees see action with the season basically over but one has to think we would've seen him last week if that was the case.   Either way, Flutie's probably not worthy of a start except for the larger leagues.   Of the WRs, Curtis Conway was clearly the go to guy with TE Freddie Jones seeing action as well.   The Seahawks rank # 9 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 23 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 17 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs. Seattle Passing Game vs San Diego Defense Matt Hasselbeck hasn't carried many FF Teams this season and I doubt it'll start now.   He's still a below average player.   WRs Koren Robinson and Darrell Jackson are the primary guys while Shaun Alexander will be involved in the passing game as well.   The Chargers rank # 15 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 22 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 15 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs. Washington Passing Game vs New Orleans Defense Tony Banks threw for 236 yards last week in a tough game with Chicago. Michael Westbrook and Rod Gardner both saw roughly equal numbers of passes thrown their way.   He only caught a couple, but TE Zeron Felmister saw 6 passes thrown his way.   You could do a lot worse for a TE.   Plus, he's got a cool name...   The Saints rank # 13 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 25 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 23 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs. /**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/ Downside Matchups:  These games feature a Defense that's been pretty strong lately. Buffalo Passing Game vs New York Jets Defense Van Pelt put together a 208 yard / 1 TD passing game last week.   As usual, Eric Moulds and Peerless Price were featured fairly evenly.   This week, the Bills face a pretty tough Jets team that ranks # 11 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 1 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 4 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs. Dallas Passing Game vs San Francisco Defense I can't imagine you're in contention in week 16 with many of these guys on the roster.   Quincy Carter's given me very little to make me think he'll do much of anything.   Of course, for the gamblers, Rocket Ismail or Joey Galloway can make something happen with just one throw, but they're definite risks.   San Francisco is ranked # 8 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 13 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 18 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs. Detroit Passing Game vs Chicago Defense Rookie Mike McMahon gave a valiant effort but it's still very clear he's a rookie QB.   Granted, he's got talent and potential but he's still very green.   Johnnie Morton is the WR of choice but TE David Sloan actually saw more balls thrown his way last week than any other Lion receiver.   That's not unusual for a new QB to focus on the shorter routes of a TE and it could continue.   The Bears rank # 12 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.  For the year, they rank # 8 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 2 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs. New Orleans Passing Game vs Washington Defense Few people expected Tampa Bay to start a track meet with New Orleans last week but that's what happened.   Aaron Brooks had 3 TDs late as the Saints tried to rally from a big deficit.   Stats are stats though and Brooks owners will take them any way they can get them.   Joe Horn and Willie Jackson saw tons of action.   With Cam Cleeland shockingly injured again, Boo Williams is back as the # 1 TE so that's good news.   The Redskins rank # 4 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 5 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 11 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs. New York Giants Passing Game vs Philadelphia Defense Kerry Collins quietly finished with nice numbers last week.   He threw for 338 yards and 1 TD.   Amani Toomer and Ike Hilliard saw lots of action with Joe Jurevicius seeing plenty of balls thrown his way too.   The Eagles have cooled lately where they rank # 16 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 2 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 1 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.   Their blitzing style can cause young QBs plenty of trouble but Collins' experience should help him. Tennessee Passing Game vs Cleveland Defense Steve McNair played a gutsy game last week at well less than 100%.   He managed 178 yards, 1 TD and 2 Interceptions.   Derrick Mason is still the primary guy and saw more looks than TE Frank Wycheck which is saying something.   This week, they'll face a surprising Brown defense that ranks # 10 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 3 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 14 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs. /**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/ Defensive Slam Dunks:  These games feature a Defense that's been very strong lately. Atlanta Passing Game vs Miami Defense Chris Chandler continued his up and down season with a monster game last week throwing for 431 yards and 2 TDs against Buffalo.   Terance Mathis, Tony Martin and Footballguy Favorite Brian Finneran all had great games. As you know though, these guys are very inconsistent.   This week, they'll face a Miami Defense that ranks # 1 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 6 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 10 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs. Baltimore Passing Game vs Tampa Bay Defense Elvis Grbac continues to at least not hurt the offense.   He threw for 181 yards last week with no TDs or Interceptions.   Qadry Ismail is the preferred target at WR with Shannon Sharpe always threatening to make an impact.   The Ravens face the Bucs who are hot right now ranking # 3 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 11 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 9 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs. Cincinnati Passing Game vs Pittsburgh Defense You pretty much have to avoid all these guys.   Jon Kitna threw for 153 yards and 3 Interceptions.   His most newsworthy accomplishment was a sideline shouting match with WR Chad Johnson.   Peter Warrick was benched for fielding a punt on his own 3 yard line.   Warrick should start this week.   They teased us early , but these are clearly still the Bengals. Pittsburgh ranks # 5 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 7 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 7 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs. San Francisco Passing Game vs Dallas Defense Garcia only had 136 yards and 1 TD (although he was very close on another) but he's still a must start in my book.   He's too good and has too many weapons.   Terrell Owens is of course a starter but J.J. Stokes or Tai Streets could be worth a look.   TE Eric Johnson is still very involved in the passing game.   Dallas ranks # 2 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks so they've been tough.   For the year, they rank # 4 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 3 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs. Tough matchups but I don't see how you can sit Garcia and Owens unless you're just loaded.   See our cheatsheet rankings for exactly where we see these guys ranked. /**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/ Bryant Analytics, Inc.

Here's how I see the Rushing Game Matchups this week. PLEASE NOTE:   See the cheatsheet online www.footballguys.com for exactly where I rank players and to determine who to start.   I always receive emails asking me how I can have a guy ranked highly on the cheatsheet but listed under a matchup that favors the Defense.   Just because one matchup may be more favorable than another, that doesn't necessarily mean I'd start the player with the best matchup.   Ahman Green may have a horrible matchup one week but unless you're sitting on Ricky Williams or Marshall Faulk, Green's your guy no matter who he's lining up against.  (Yes, even after last week's performance)  The matchup info is meant to be just one more tool in your box when it comes to deciding between players. Stats are provided by Mike Hall's excellent FLM League Management Software. http://www.fflm.com/ for more info.   Fantasy Points Allowed by position numbers are from ESPN.com.   Target numbers are from our Footballguy Andy Hicks. Let's get to it. Joe /**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/ Locks:  These games feature Defenses that have struggled lately. Arizona's Michael Pittman vs Carolina Defense After a few weeks of worrying about Thomas Jones, Michael Pittman seemed to clearly be the prime RB here last week.   He rushed 14 times for 58 yards (4.1 ypc) plus a TD.   Thomas Jones, on the other hand, only had 4 carries for 18 yards.   The Panthers rank # 30 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks so you have to like his chances again this week. For the year, Carolina ranks # 30 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs. Atlanta's Maurice Smith / Rodney Thomas vs Miami Defense Probably the strongest criticism of Smith you could offer is that he's losing time to Rodney Thomas...   Smith was ineffective again last week but did score the cheap TD.   He ran 14 times for 23 yards (1.6 ypc).   Thomas had 41 yards on 13 carries (3.2 ypc) and did bring a spark.   Smith injured his toe and even though it's not believed to be serious, it's hard to put much faith in him with Thomas coming on.   This week, they'll face a Dolphin defense that's been soft lately ranking # 29 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 17 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.   Make sure to understand, I don't have much faith in either of these guys so check the cheatsheets to see where I rank them. It's just that the Dolphins have been very weak lately against the run. Carolina's Richard Huntley vs Arizona Defense Huntley ran pretty well last week against a tough St. Louis defense so it's tough to count him out.   He posted 74 yards on 19 carries (3.9 ypc) plus a score.   This week, he gets a much softer defense in Arizona that Emmitt Smith ran over last week.   The Cardinals rank # 26 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 30 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs. Chicago's Anthony Thomas vs Detroit Defense Thomas put in a very Bearish workmanlike effort last week with 82 yards on 24 carries (3.4 ypc)   Clearly, he's the kind of tough back this team wants yet he has the skills and speed to be more than just a grinder.   This week, he'll likely see lots of action against the Lions ranked # 22 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 26 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs. Green Bay's Ahman Green vs Minnesota Defense Ahman Green bounced back as expected and proved why he's one of the league's elite backs.   He rolled up 150 yards on 21 carries (7.4 ypc).   He did have a 43 yarder thrown in there.   He did leave with some breathing problems but he is expected to be ok this week.   Watch to make sure, though.   This week, he'll face a Viking team that looks like they've rolled over.   The Vikings rank # 31 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks and # 31 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.   It doesn't always play out in real life, but on paper, it doesn't get much better than this. Miami's Lamar Smith vs Atlanta Defense Again, Lamar Smith was weak.   12 rushes for 33 yards (2.8 ypc) and a big fumble.   But the Dolphins don't seem too excited about going with anyone else so there's always that chance for a cheap TD, sort of like with Atlanta's Maurice Smith.   I don't have much faith in him but this week, he'll face the soft Falcon defense that's ranked # 28 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks and let the Bills run wild on them last week.   For the year, they rank # 28 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs so you have to like the matchup.   Check the cheatsheets to see exactly where we rank him. New York Jet's Curtis Martin vs Buffalo Defense Martin put in his typical workhorse effort Sunday with 122 yards on 23 carries (5.3 ypc)   Look for more of the same against the Bills ranked # 23 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 25 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs. St. Louis' Marshall Faulk vs Indianapolis Defense Yawn.   Start Faulk.   He rolled up 202 yards on 30 carries last week (6.7 ypc)   Best player in the game yada yada.   He's the man.   If it matters to you (and it shouldn't) the Colts rank # 27 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks and # 29 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs. /**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/ Prime Matchups:  These games feature Defenses that haven't been strong lately. Denver's Terrell Davis vs Oakland Defense Terrell Davis jumps back in the fray after a week of rest.   Oakland's defense has improved from awful to just bad over the last few weeks.   They rank # 24 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 21 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.   Oakland allowed Tennessee's Skip Hicks and Eddie George to run for 87 yards last week so they are getting better. Jacksonville's Stacey Mack vs Kansas City Defense We caught a little flak last week for listing Stacey Mack in the lock column against the Raiders but Mack helped us out with another 100+ yard day.   He rushed 27 times for 111 yards (4.1 ypc) plus 2 TDs.   Of course, just to make you Mack owners nervous, Coach Tom Coughlin said this week that Fred Taylor could see action this week or next... http://www.jacksonville.com/tu-online/stories/122501/jag_8179728.html   I personally don't see it this week but with this season, you never know. Kansas City ranks # 19 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 23 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs. New Orleans' Ricky Williams vs Washington Defense Williams owners (like me) groaned when the Saints fell behind so early last week.   Williams was effectively taken out of the game.   Although truthfully, he's been less and less a factor lately regardless of the score. He ran for 26 yards on 10 carries (2.6 ypc) and caught 4 passes for 15 yards.   That's pretty small.   This week, he'll face the Redskins who rank # 20 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 24 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs. Tennessee's Eddie George vs Cleveland Defense As weird as it sounds, Eddie George will get the carries this week by default as Skip Hicks injured his hamstring and won't see action.   The Browns rank # 25 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks and for the year, they rank # 20 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs. /**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/ Even Matchups:  These games feature no real advantage either way Baltimore's Terry Allen vs Tampa Bay Defense Allen looked solid last week with 91 yards on 22 carries (4.1 ypc) plus a score.   He showed little ill effects of being off and actually may have benefited from the rest.   This week, he'll face a resurging Buc defense that's ranked # 13 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks.   That's up from # 21 last week.   For the year, they rank # 10 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs. Buffalo's Shawn Bryson vs New York Jets Defense As you know, Bryson went wild last week rushing for 130 yards on 16 carries (8.1 ypc) plus 2 scores.   He also tacked on 31 yards on 3 receptions. Bryson did have a 68 yard run which padded the stats a little but they all count.   Henry will likely sit again giving Bryson another start.   The Jets rank # 18 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 27 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs. New York Giant's Tiki Barber / Ron Dayne vs Philadelphia Defense Neither RB saw much action last week with Barber rushing 12 times for 47 yards (3.9 ypc) and Dayne only rushing 7 times for 42 yards (6.0 ypc) and a score.   Barber of course, is more active in the passing game.   This week, they'll face an Eagle defense ranked # 15 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 9 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs. San Diego's LaDainian Tomlinson vs Seattle Defense So much for that rookie ""wall"".   Tomlinson rushed 27 times for 145 yards (5.4 ypc) last week.   Clearly, he's the primary focus of the offense.   San Diego has a bye in week 17 (that's not really fair is it?) so this is the last game.   Drew Brees could see some action which probably means Tomlinson will be even more the focus if that's possible.   The Seahawks rank # 17 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 14 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs. San Francisco's Garrison Hearst / Kevan Barlow vs Dallas Defense Hearst had a solid but not great game last week with 72 yards on 17 carries (4.2 ypc)   Kevan Barlow carried the ball 6 times for 25 yards (4.2 ypc) Barlow also caught 3 passes.   He's creeping into Hearst's time.   This week, they'll face a Cowboy Defense ranked # 16 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 13 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs. Tampa Bay's Mike Alstott / Warrick Dunn vs Baltimore Defense It's tough to predict too much with these guys but Mike Alstott was clearly the featured RB last week rushing for 101 yards on 24 carries (4.2 ypc) with a score.   Warrick Dunn had 10 rushes for 32 yards (3.2 ypc) and added 46 yards receiving plus a TD.   This week, they'll face a Baltimore defense that's bark is worse than it's bite lately.   They rank # 21 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 2 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.   That just means that lately, they've given up a lot of yards.   The Tampa backs have been very up and down so be leery. /**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/ Downside Matchups:  These games feature a Defense that's been pretty strong lately. Cleveland's Jamel White vs Tennessee Defense Jamel White prompted lots of ""where's he been?"" comments from the Brown faithful last week as he rolled up 131 yards on 21 carries (6.2 ypc)   With James Jackson out and Ben Gay still too unreliable, it looks like the Browns will continue to utilize White.   He'll face a tough Defense this week in Tennessee that ranks # 5 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 15 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs. Dallas' Emmitt Smith vs San Francisco Defense Smith is probably happy as he got a chance to pad his stats last week with 128 yards on 26 carries (4.9 ypc)   He ran pretty well after a slow start and being totally and repeatedly shut down at the goalline.   He's clearly just an average to below average back at this point in his career.   He does look like he'll be able to hold off Troy Hambrick though.   The 49ers rank # 3 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 18 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.   Don't discount the fact Smith is going for another 1,000 yard season.   Of course, with Quincy Carter at QB, I'd give it to Emmitt too. Detroit's Lamont Warren / James Stewart vs Chicago Defense James Stewart re-injured his troublesome ankle last week and Lamont Warren came in and played well rushing 9 times for 48 yards (5.3 ypc) against a super tough Pittsburgh team.   (Although he did get 34 of those yards on one run)   The going isn't much easier this week against the Bears who rank # 9 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks and # 11 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.   Keep an eye out this week to see whether Stewart or Warren will play. Indianapolis' Dominic Rhodes vs St. Louis Defense Rhodes put together another excellent game last week against the Jets with 126 yards on 17 carries (7.4 ypc) with 1 score.   He also tacked on 26 yards on 3 receptions.   He did have 2 fumbles though.   This week, he'll face a tough Ram defense ranked # 8 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 5 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs. Although it should be noted they let Carolina's Richard Huntley run for 74 yards and a TD on them last week so it's not like they're invincible. Minnesota's Michael Bennett vs Green Bay Defense Bennett suffered last week from the same problem he's had most of the year. He just didn't get enough carries to make a difference.   Although one could argue that after producing just 17 yards on the 11 carries he was given (1.5 ypc), he didn't deserve any more.   Bennett's a percentage guy that'll be shut down for a while and then eventually break one long.   It's just that most teams can't afford to wait as long it seems to be taking Bennett to get going.   This week, he'll face a Packer team ranked # 14 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks.   For the season, they rank # 16 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs. Philadelphia's Duce Staley vs New York Giants Defense Duce Staley has apparently forgotten how to run the ball lately but it doesn't matter as he's clearly the Eagles #1 receiver.   Last week, he rushed 15 times for 35 yards (2.3 ypc)   But he caught 9 passes for 103 yards.   This week, he'll face the Giants who rank # 10 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks.   More importantly for Staley, they rank # 6 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks. For the year, they rank # 3 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs. Pittsburgh's Jerome Bettis / Chris Fuamatu-Ma'afala vs Cincinnati Defense Coach Cowher has upgraded Bettis to Questionable for this week and says he'll play if he's healthy.   Tough to say who'll get the call but one has to think that if he plays, Bettis will be used just enough to keep him fresh.   The Steelers are winning without him, have a very beatable opponent in Cincinnati this week, and don't want to jeopardize their playoff situation where they know they'll need Bettis.   Plus, the Bengals rush Defense is tougher than many think.   They rank # 12 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 7 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs. Seattle's Shaun Alexander vs San Diego Defense Alexander looked to be making a statement that he should have been the guy all along with 96 yards on 28 carries (3.4 ypc) and a score plus another 36 yards receiving with a TD.   He'll face the Chargers this week that rank # 11 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 6 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs. Washington's Stephen Davis vs New Orleans Defense Davis was held pretty much in check against the Bears last week with 57 yards on 22 carries (2.6 ypc)   He did get the score though.   He's clearly the prime weapon here.   How much would YOU depend on Tony Banks?   This week, he faces a Saints defense that's been tough lately ranking # 4 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 19 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs. /**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/ Defensive Slam Dunks:  These games feature a Defense that's been very strong lately. Cincinnati's Corey Dillon vs Pittsburgh Defense Dillon ran well against the overhyped Raven rush defense.   As the numbers showed in the week 15 matchup info, Baltimore's been nothing special against the run lately.   They were ranked # 12 last week for Dillon and this week, they rank # 21 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks. Sometimes the numbers tell you more than the reputation.   This week though, the Steelers rep is backed up with the numbers.   Pittsburgh ranks # 2 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 1 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.   This is a MUCH tougher matchup than last week against the Ravens. Kansas City's Priest Holmes / Tony Richardson vs Jacksonville Defense Holmes had a on ""off"" day for him with ""only"" 80 yards on 23 carries (3.5) and 12 yards receiving.   He'll be fine.   Tony Richardson stole another cheap TD.   Richardson's a gamble as he won't likely get many yards even on a good day but he's a threat for a short TD.   The Jaguars have been tough lately ranking # 1 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 8 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.   I'd still consider Holmes a must start in most leagues, but this is a tough matchup. Oakland's Charlie Garner / Tyrone Wheatley / Zack Crockett vs Denver Defense Charlie Garner ran well when he ran but as has often been the case lately, he didn't run enough.  He had 54 yards on just 10 carries (5.4 ypc)   And most of those were between the 20's.   Zack Crockett and Tyrone Wheatley both saw action making it nearly impossible to pick which one will do anything.   The Broncos rank # 6 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 4 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs so it'll be a touch matchup. /**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/ That'll do it for the Rushing Matchups.

VIP VEGAS VACATION Win a VIP Vegas Vacation OR $600 CASH!  http://cbs.sportsline.com/links/6/1/223/sffpn1019v.cgi THE GRIDIRON GURU Welcome to Gridiron Guru, where we'll answer your questions  about players and offer Fantasy Football roster advice. We  invite you to send your own scouting reports and comments on  players to: gridguru@commissioner.com. You'll get the chance  to be heard by thousands of Fantasy players just like  yourself!  Matt Biggins, Los Angeles, CA: Which two receivers should I  start this weekend: Todd Pinkston, Bill Schroeder, Chris  Carter, Terry Glenn or James McKnight? Who would you  recommend starting out of Duce Staley, Stephen Davis, Ron  Dayne, Kevan Barlow and Jason Brookins? G.G. - As long as Schroeder (ankle) is healthy, he's a must- start against a Minnesota defense that allowed Charlie Batch  to throw for 345 yards and three touchdowns last weekend.  Miami has a bye, so McKnight is obviously not an option.  Pinkston and Glenn both have good matchups, but we'd have to  go with Carter in this case. This season has been very  unpredictable, so going with your most established player in  this case is the best move. To answer your second question,  we'd recommend Davis against a vulnerable Carolina defense  and Dayne against Philadelphia. It's tough to choose Davis,  but Barlow has a bye and both Staley and Brookins will be  splitting carries at best, so our hands are tied.  Jeff Smith, Tampa, FL: I have Jeff Garcia, who has a bye  this week. I have the option of starting Jim Miller or  picking up Chris Weinke. What do you recommend? G.G. - Miller has been very inconsistent from a Fantasy  perspective, so we'd have to side with Weinke. He'll be  facing a Washington defense decimated by injuries and  vulnerable to players like Muhsin Muhammad, Donald Hayes  and Wesley Walls. Weinke could have a big game. Scott Buzby, Newark, DE: Who should I start this week:  Shannon Sharpe or Bubba Franks?  Also, is it time to drop  James Thrash? Kevin Johnson, Laveranues Coles, Todd Pinkston  and Joe Jurevicius are all still available. G.G. - Franks has been Brett Favre's favorite target in the  red zone, but Sharpe is one of the best tight ends in the  league. Sharpe will always give you good production from the  tight end spot, and we highly doubt that Franks will be able  to continue to score touchdowns at his current pace of one  per game. As far as Thrash goes, we feel he's just not good  enough to be facing No.1 cornerbacks on a weekly basis, so  his numbers will be inconsistent at best. Your best bet is  to drop him and go after another No. 1-caliber wideout like  Johnson, who could emerge as a reliable Fantasy player.

He is the best  offensive option the Chiefs have, and he even has more  rushing yards than Marshall Faulk after five weeks. With  Dick Vermeil calling the shots in Kansas City, Holmes will  continue to be a productive player all season.

Miami has a bye, so McKnight is obviously not an option. Pinkston and Glenn both have good matchups, but we'd have to go with Carter in this case. This season has been very unpredictable, so going with your most established player in this case is the best move. To answer your second question, we'd recommend Davis against a vulnerable Carolina defense and Dayne against Philadelphia. It's tough to choose Davis, but Barlow has a bye and both Staley and Brookins will be splitting carries at best, so our hands are tied. </p></font></td>  </tr>  </table>    <br>    <table width=""600"" border=""0"" cellspacing=""0"" cellpadding=""5"" bgcolor=""#EDF2F6"">  <tr>  <td><b><font face=""Arial"" size=""2"" color=""#163786"">  <!-- Q2 title -->  Question - Jeff Smith, Tampa, FL </font></b><p><font face=""Arial"" size=""2"">  <!-- Q2 -->  I have <b>Jeff Garcia</b>, who has a bye this week.

Enjoy. /**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/ Hi Folks, Doing our best to get these to you early in the week as you juggle your lineups for this final week 17.   Here's how I see the Rushing Game Matchups this week. PLEASE NOTE:   See the cheatsheet online www.footballguys.com for exactly where I rank players and to determine who to start.   I always receive emails asking me how I can have a guy ranked highly on the cheatsheet but listed under a matchup that favors the Defense.   Just because one matchup may be more favorable than another, that doesn't necessarily mean I'd start the player with the best matchup.   Ahman Green may have a horrible matchup one week but unless you're sitting on Ricky Williams or Marshall Faulk, Green's your guy no matter who he's lining up against.  (Yes, even after last week's performance)  The matchup info is meant to be just one more tool in your box when it comes to deciding between players. Stats are provided by Mike Hall's excellent FLM League Management Software. http://www.fflm.com/ for more info.   Fantasy Points Allowed by position numbers are from ESPN.com.   Target numbers are from our Footballguy Andy Hicks. Let's get to it. Joe /**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/ Locks:  These games feature Defenses that have struggled lately. Baltimore's Terry Allen vs Minnesota Defense Terry Allen ran hard last week where he rushed 20 times for 74 yards (3.3 ypc) against a tough Buc team.   It'll be much easier this week against the swiss cheese Vikings ranked # 30 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks.   Although, these Vikings did shut down Ahman Green last week. For the year, they rank # 31 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs. Denver's Terrell Davis vs Indianapolis Defense Terrell Davis looked good again rushing for 89 yards on 18 carries (4.9 ypc) It's been a tough year and you can bet he'll want to finish strong.   The Colts rank # 23 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks. For the year, they rank # 29 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs. New England's Antowain Smith vs Carolina Defense A rested Antowain Smith faces the soft Carolina defense that's ranked # 31 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 20 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.   Great matchup. Pittsburgh's Chris Fuamatu-Ma'afala / Jerome Bettis vs Cleveland Defense Fuamatu-Ma'afala was a workhorse on the ground Sunday but didn't have a lot to show for it.   He ran 25 times for 55 yards (2.2 ypc)   He did score on a receiving TD.   He'll face a weak Cleveland defense ranked # 29 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 20 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs. Washington's Stephen Davis vs Arizona Defense Stephen Davis looked great rushing for 111 yards on 21 carries (5.3 ypc) and the score.   He left with a knee tweak but it doesn't look to be serious. Ki-Jana Carter played great after Davis left.   The Cardinals rank # 21 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 22 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs. /**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/ Prime Matchups:  These games feature Defenses that haven't been strong lately. Buffalo's Shawn Bryson / Travis Henry / Sammy Morris vs Miami Defense Bryson ran wild again rushing 28 times for 107 yards (3.8 ypc).   Sammy Morris spelled him for a few carries and looked good too but it seems Bryson is clearly the man here.   It's possible Henry could see action so keep an eye on this one through the week.   The Dolphins have fallen down to # 28 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 17 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs. Dallas' Emmitt Smith vs Detroit Defense Emmitt looked very solid again rushing for 126 yards on 26 carries (4.8 ypc) although he failed to score.   He needs a little over 60 yards to get 1,000 for the season so you can bet he'll be gunning for that.   The Lions rank # 18 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks and # 24 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs. New York Giants' Tiki Barber / Ron Dayne vs Green Bay Defense Barber saw more action with 16 carries and 71 yards (4.4 ypc) but it was Dayne who scored with 59 yards on 8 carries (7.4 ypc)   Barber was very active again in the passing game.   The Packers let Michael Bennett run well Sunday and have slipped to # 27 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 13 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs. New York Jet's Curtis Martin vs Oakland Defense Martin put in another Martin Like day with 115 yards on 19 carries (6.1 ypc) The Jets may have problems, but Martin isn't one.   He'll face an Oakland defense ranked # 19 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks. For the year, they rank # 21 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs. Oakland's Charlie Garner vs New York Jets Defense The Raiders don't look nearly as strong as they did.   Garner only had 9 carries Sunday for 23 yards (2.6 ypc)   Tyrone Wheatley only had 5 carries. This week they've got a nice matchup as they'll face the Jets ranked # 26 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 27 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs. Seattle's Shaun Alexander vs Kansas City Defense Alexander didn't do much Sunday rushing 23 times for 59 yards (2.6 ypc)   He 'll be ok though and gets to face a Chief defense ranked # 22 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 23 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs. St. Louis' Marshall Faulk vs Atlanta Defense Start Faulk.   The question will be of course how much he plays but it was pretty obvious Sunday that Mike Martz lets his guys play.   Trung Canidate could have really used the work but he warmed the bench while Faulk went nuts.   I'd say you'll get at least a half, maybe much more out of Faulk and half of Faulk is worth more than most backs.   The Falcons rank # 24 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks and # 28 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs. /**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/ Even Matchups:  These games feature no real advantage either way Arizona's Michael Pittman vs Washington Defense Just when it looked like Michael Pittman was going to take over the clear cut # 1 RB role, Thomas Jones steps in with 16 carries.   Pittman rushed 12 times for 89 yards (7.4 ypc) which was bolstered by a 39 yarder.   Jones ran for 69 yards on 16 carries (4.3 ypc)   This was Carolina, though.   This week will feature a tougher test with Washington ranked # 8 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they've been pretty soft though and rank # 25 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs. Kansas City's Priest Holmes / Tony Richardson vs Seattle Defense Priest Holmes ran 27 times for 91 yards (3.4 ypc) plus the score.   Tony Richardson didn't have a carry.   This week, he'll face the Seahawks ranked # 12 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 14 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs. Miami's Lamar Smith / Travis Minor vs Buffalo Defense This is getting embarrassing.   Smith rushed 7 times for 4 yards (0.6 ypc) Travis Minor had 33 yards on 9 carries (3.7 ypc)   He's becoming less and less of a factor with each game.   The Dolphins are in the playoffs but find themselves playing a different style of ball than they have been.   Minor's a threat to go long on the screen passes and Smith is a long shot for a cheap TD.   They'll face the Bills ranked # 13 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks and # 26 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs. Minnesota's Michael Bennett vs Baltimore Defense We said Bennett just needed carries and he got them Sunday rushing 25 times for 104 yards (4.2 ypc)   He'll face a Baltimore defense that's numbers don' t back up it's reputation this week - they rank # 25 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 2 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs. New Orleans' Ricky Williams vs San Francisco Defense Even though he didn't score, it was a better performance by Williams who rushed 17 times for 74 yards (4.4 ypc)   The Saints clearly want him to be more involved as he was Sunday.   This week, he'll face a 49er defense ranked # 17 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks and # 18 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs. San Francisco's Garrison Hearst vs New Orleans Defense Garrison Hearst was a non factor Sunday with just 35 yards on 11 carries (3.2 ypc)   Kevan Barlow didn't do much either so it wasn't like he lost time to another player.   This week, he gets the Saints who rank # 15 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 19 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs. Tampa Bay's Warrick Dunn / Mike Alstott vs Philadelphia Defense Tampa's One-Two punch continues to work.   Alstott had 80 yards on 14 carries (5.7 ypc) and Dunn carried the ball 13 times for 47 yards (3.6 ypc) Alstott's been more effective on the ground but Dunn seems to be more involved in the passing game.   This week, they'll face an Eagle defense ranked # 20 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks and # 9 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs. /**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/ Downside Matchups:  These games feature a Defense that's been pretty strong lately. Cincinnati's Corey Dillon vs Tennessee Defense Dillon showed again he can run on any defense.   He had 91 yards on 21 carries (4.3 ypc) against the Steelers.   He'll face the Titans this week ranked # 6 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks so it won 't get much easier.   They rank # 15 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs. Detroit's Lamont Warren / James Stewart vs Dallas Defense The Detroit RBs were horrible on the ground in this one with Lamont Warren gaining 19 yards on 6 carries (3.2 ypc).   Cory Schlesinger did catch 11 passes though so maybe he's worth a longshot pick there.   The Cowboys rank # 14 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks and # 12 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs. Green Bay's Ahman Green vs New York Giants Defense Green was shut down on the ground with just 31 yards on 16 carries (1.9 ypc) although he did score.   Go figure.   He's still too good to sit in my opinion.   This week, he'll face the Giants ranked # 10 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 3 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs so it's a tough matchup, although I think I'd start Green unless you really have a solid alternative. Indianapolis' Dominic Rhodes vs Denver Defense Again, Dominic Rhodes looked excellent rushing for 83 yards on 20 carries (4.2 ypc) with a score.   He'll face the Broncos this week ranked # 7 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 4 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.   The Broncos are definitely surging after the win in Oakland but I still like Rhodes. Jacksonville's Stacey Mack vs Chicago Defense Mack went off last week with 125 yards on 16 carries (7.8 ypc) and a score. It'll be tougher this week against Chicago that ranks # 9 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 10 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs. Philadelphia's Duce Staley vs Tampa Bay Defense Staley's receiving numbers had been carrying him lately and this week he paid the price.   He only rushed 8 times for 23 yards (2.9 ypc) and was shut  down receiving with just 2 receptions for -1 yards.   This week, he'll face a surging Buc defense ranked # 16 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks and # 11 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs. Tennessee's Eddie George vs Cincinnati Defense Eddie George looked the old Eddie Sunday with 130 yards on 26 carries (5.0 ypc)   Plus 2 scores.  This week he'll face a Bengal defense ranked # 11 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 7 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs. /**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/ Defensive Slam Dunks:  These games feature a Defense that's been very strong lately. Atlanta's Maurice Smith vs St. Louis Defense Again, Maurice Smith ran poorly but got a cheap TD.   He managed just 38 yards on 15 carries (2.5 ypc).   Bob Christian stole 10 carries where he gained 33 yards (3.3 ypc)   They're both a gamble against a tough Ram defense ranked # 3 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks. For the year, they rank # 5 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs. Carolina's Richard Huntley vs New England Defense Huntley ran pretty well last week gaining 62 yards on 12 carries (5.2 ypc). He just didn't get enough carries for this awful Carolina team.   That won't get any better this week agains the Patriots ranked # 2 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 16 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs. Chicago's Anthony Thomas vs Jacksonville Defense Thomas ran 25 times for 76 yards (3.0 ypc) Sunday.   He'll face a tougher defense in Jacksonville that's been awesome lately ranking # 1 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 8 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.   Thomas is still probably a starter in most leagues, but the Jaguars have been extremely stingy of late. Cleveland's Jamel White vs Pittsburgh Defense White only had 42 yards on 21 carries (2.0 ypc) but did score twice.   Corey Dillon showed the Steeler defense wasn't perfect last week.  They're still tough though ranked # 4 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 1 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs. /**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/ That'll do it for the Rushing Matchups.   Passing Matchups to follow.

bryant@cheatsheets.net,0,0,0.985,95560992-3deb-4381-961d-8de0c8d8ae04,"body: Clipped from the article from Kevin Seifert, Star Tribune entire article:  http://www.startribune.com/stories/510/915564.html Vikings quarterback Todd Bouman, declaring that the injured thumb on  his throwing hand is much better, said today he's ready to go Sunday  against the Jacksonville Jaguars. ""I took all of the snaps today,'' said Bouman, who has moved up to  startiang quarterback after Daunte Culpepper injured his knee. ""The  thumb is a little sore, but I'll be ready to go on Sunday."" Bouman continued: ""I've come a long way the last couple of days. With  all of the treatment I have gotten, I can squeeze the ball and I can  throw pretty much anything I want to throw, so I don't foresee it  being a problem."" The St. Cloud State product injured his thumb in the team's 27-24  loss last Sunday to Detroit.  Bouman has had limited practice action this week. Backup Spurgeon  Wynn has taken more snaps the past few days, and the team brought in  Ramaro Miller, cut in training camp, should he have been needed to  back up Wynn. Bouman today called dealing with the injury just ""part of the game.  You've just got to come in and get treatment, and hopefully things  will turn around fast. It's progressed each day, and that's all you  can do."" He said there's a risk that it could be re-injured Sunday. ""It's not  going to heal until the season is over. So any time if you get hit on  it, it's going to re-injure it or aggravate it. But you've just got  to deal with it."" Concerning Culpepper's surgery, Green said today that it ""went as  expected ... and he has a positive prognosis. Daunte's rehabilitation  will begin immediately."" While there's be no definitive word on when Culpepper might return to  the lineup, he could end up missing the season's remaining three  games. The consequence of that appears minimal, considering the  Vikings are virtually eliminated from a playoff berth. **************************** Our View:  With Todd taking all the snaps on Thursday, he is a very  safe bet to start on Sunday.  Culpepper is not expected to return  this season so Todd should start the remainder of the season unless  he is injured further.

TAKE OFF IN AS LITTLE AS 3 HOURS & SAVE UP TO 70% OFF </b> <br> <br> This week, we have added a new feature called Last-Minute Getaways. Unlike Internet-only specials, we give you many days to travel and more options for less. Instead of being locked into a Saturday departure and returning the following Monday or Tuesday, we give you many more choices. You can depart Thursday, Friday or Saturday and return on Sunday, Monday or Tuesday, depending on the inventory of cheap seats. Plus, to help you save even more money, we have negotiated a special rental car rate or special hotel rate to go with the airfare. What is great about this offer is that you may be flying and staying at a major hotel cheaper than the lowest published airfare alone. This is a very exciting new program for our visitors and our Bestfares.com members. Our members can receive an additional $30 off any of the airfare/hotel or airfare/car programs based on two people traveling together, giving you an unbelievable travel deal.

Cam Cleeland (NO) had his protective boot removed from his ankle, but  he is doubtful to play this week. Chad Lewis (Phi) was able to practice this week and will start this  week despite a sore knee.  He appears on the injury report as  probable.

bryant@cheatsheets.net,0,0,0.935,6c4457a1-d80a-4586-8e0b-dabbe98ed896,"body: Entire story:  http://espn.go.com/nfl/news/2001/1117/1279805.html Leading rusher Correll Buckhalter is among three rookie players suspended for one game by Philadelphia Eagles head coach Andy Reid on Saturday after a Friday night incident in which the trio was taken into custody on possible drug charges. None of the players will participate in Sunday's game at Dallas, nor will they be allowed to even make the trip, as the result of the team action. ESPN.com has learned that safety Terrence Carroll, an undrafted free agent from Oregon State, is the only one of the players who will be charged. The players were stopped Friday night as they drove on South Street, a trendy area of shops and clubs, and police detected an odor of marijuana. Carroll is expected to be charged with marijuana possession and he remains in custody pending bond. Buckhalter and cornerback Darrel Crutchfield, an undrafted free agent from Clemson, were released on Saturday morning and will not face charges. Carroll was to have been deactivated for the game at Dallas and might not have made the trip anyway. ""We are obviously aware of the incident involving three of our first-year players last night in Philadelphia,"" said Reid in a statement released by the club. ""I've met with the players that I could meet with this morning and they will be suspended for this Sunday's game. . . . We will not have any further comment on this matter and we will handle the rest of this situation internally."" The players will each be docked $12,294, the equivalent of one game check based on their rookie minimum base salaries of $209,000. More significant for Carroll is that he almost certainly will be in violation of the NFL's personal conduct policy and may also have violated the substance abuse policy. A fourth-round draft choice from Nebraska, the hard-running Buckhalter has rushed for 428 yards and two touchdowns on 92 carries this year, starting several games in place of the injured Duce Staley. Although Staley has returned to the starting lineup, and had his best game of the season last week, Buckhalter is still a key part of the Eagles offense. [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [  OUR VIEW  ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] Shaking the head here.   Bottom line is this has a positive effect on Staley. Thanks to Footballguy Mike Green for pointing me to this one. Joe /**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/ Bryant Analytics, Inc.

Welcome to another edition of the 2001 Fantasy Football  Newsletter! The newsletter will arrive in your e-mail inbox  at the end of every week, and will include news about the  web site; tips on using all the features available; and  answers to your player-related questions from the ""Gridiron  Guru.""  PLAN FOR THE PLAYOFFS The Fantasy season is nearing its end, and the playoffs are on the horizon. For Fantasy 2001 players, the playoffs begin with NFL week 15 (games of Dec. 22-23) and last two weeks,  with the championship game in week 16 (games of Dec. 29-30.) If you're in a Football Commissioner league, go to Schedule,  Playoffs to see when your playoffs start and how many rounds  they last. Of course, the matchups are probably still not  determined, so you may not see teams listed in the brackets.  The commissioner of your league is responsible for adding  the teams to your playoff brackets at the end of your  regular season.  If your team is still in contention, go to  NFL Teams, Schedule and take note of the NFL teams with byes  during your playoff weeks, so you know which players will be  available if - and WHEN - your team competes in a playoff  matchup. GAME-BY-GAME ANALYSIS Go to Players, Game Log to see how a particular player did in each game this season. The player's statistics in the  common categories will be displayed for each game. If you are breaking down free agents, the game log is great way to see who's been getting the most consistent production. MVP.com  Save 10% on Speak No Evil, Hear No Evil Monkey Bikes...

We  invite you to send your own scouting reports and comments on  players to: gridguru@commissioner.com. You'll get the chance  to be heard by thousands of Fantasy players just like  yourself!  Mike Blake: I'm having trouble filling my No. 2 WR spot.  Should I start Az-Zahir Hakim, Todd Pinkston or Muhsin  Muhammad in week ten?  G.G. - Hakim is a hit-or-miss type, so he's risky. Pinkston  has done nothing in his last four games, and he's losing  playing time to Freddie Mitchell. Muhammad bounced back from  a few bad performances to catch six passes for 75 yards last  weekend against St. Louis, and has had some past success  against this week's opponent, San Francisco. Go with  Muhammad.  Russell Brown: My league starts 2 QBs. Donovan McNabb is one  of my starters. Who else should I start? I have Tom Brady,  Vinny Testaverde and Doug Flutie.    G.G. - Testaverde's Fantasy value has taken a real hit this  season because of the Jets' conservative offense. Flutie  struggled last week against a bad Denver secondary, and  won't have an easier time against Oakland. We'd suggest  playing Brady, who will start against St. Louis despite the  return of Drew Bledsoe. Brady has thrown 11 touchdowns in  his last five games, and is playing too well to bench.  Chris Gilcrest: Who would you start at QB this weekend: Rich  Gannon or Kerry Collins? Which one of these four RBs would  you bench: Eddie George, Michael Pittman, Mike Anderson,  Curtis Martin?   G.G. - Collins has the better matchup of the two QBs, but  he's far too inconsistent to start over a player like  Gannon. Oakland will be looking to bounce back from a subpar  performance against Seattle, so look for Gannon to have a  solid game. As for your second question, bench Mike  Anderson. You can't bench Martin, no matter how bad the  matchup may be. George has four touchdowns in his last three  games against Cincinnati, and is worth starting despite his  struggles this season; and Pittman's matchup against Detroit  is too good to ignore.

Of course, the matchups are probably still not determined, so you may not see teams listed in the brackets. The commissioner of your league is responsible for adding the teams to your playoff brackets at the end of your regular season.<p> If your team is still in contention, go to <b><i>NFL Teams, Schedule</i></b> and take note of the NFL teams with byes during your playoff weeks, so you know which players will be available if - and WHEN - your team competes in a playoff matchup. </font></p></td>  </tr>  </table>    <hr align=""left"" width=""600"" size=""1"" color=""#CCD0D3"">    <table width=""600"" border=""0"" cellspacing=""0"" cellpadding=""5"">  <tr>  <td width=""600"" valign=""top"">  <b><font face=""Arial"" size=""+1"" color=""#163786"">  <a name=tip2>  <!-- Second tip title goes here -->  Game-by-Game Analysis </font></b><p><font face=""Arial"" size=""2"">  <!-- Second tip text goes here --> Go to <b><i>Players, Game Log</i></b> to see how a particular player did in each game this season.

Pinkston has done nothing in his last four games, and he's losing playing time to Freddie Mitchell.

Flutie  struggled last week against a bad <b>Denver</b> secondary, and  won't have an easier time against <b>Oakland</b>. We'd suggest  playing Brady, who will start against <b>St. Louis</b> despite the  return of <b>Drew Bledsoe</b>. Brady has thrown 11 touchdowns in  his last five games, and is playing too well to bench.  </p></font></td>  </tr>  </table>    <br>    <table width=""600"" border=""0"" cellspacing=""0"" cellpadding=""5"" bgcolor=""#EDF2F6"">  <tr>  <td><b><font face=""Arial"" size=""2"" color=""#163786"">  <!-- Q3 title -->  Question - Chris Gilcrest </font></b><p><font face=""Arial"" size=""2"">  <!-- Q3 -->  Who would you start at QB this weekend: <b>Rich  Gannon</b> or <b>Kerry Collins</b>?

Oakland will be looking to bounce back from a subpar  performance against Seattle, so look for Gannon to have a  solid game. As for your second question, bench Mike  Anderson. You can't bench Martin, no matter how bad the  matchup may be. George has four touchdowns in his last three  games against <b>Cincinnati</b>, and is worth starting despite his  struggles this season; and Pittman's matchup against <b>Detroit</b>  is too good to ignore.  </p></font></td>  </tr>  </table>  <br   <hr align=""left"" width=""600"" size=""1"" color=""#CCD0D3"">    <table width=""600"" border=""0"" cellspacing=""0"" cellpadding=""5"">  <tr>  <td width=""600"" valign=""top"">  <b><font face=""Arial"" size=""+1"" color=""#163786"">  <a name=tip3>  Tip of the Week  </font></b><p><font face=""Arial"" size=""2"">  <!-- Tip of the Week goes here --> <b>Keith Simmons, Boulder, CO</b>: Can <b>Terrell Davis</b> ever stay  healthy?

no.address@enron.com,0,0,0.938,2ffd30cf-61a6-4bd5-9d75-b0d428bbe004,"body: I know that this is a difficult time for all of us.  With everything going on inside the company as well as in the world around us, we have been carefully considering whether a holiday celebration is appropriate this year.  To be honest, employee feedback has been mixed.  Many viewed the holiday party as a unique opportunity for us to come together as Enron employees to share the spirit of the season.  Others felt a holiday party would be improper given the company's current circumstances. After weighing these points of view, we have ultimately decided to cancel the all-Enron holiday party that was scheduled for December 8.  Given what has transpired over the past month, it could be considered imprudent for Enron to incur the expense of such an event.  I regret that this action is necessary because I recognize that your hard work throughout the year merits a holiday celebration and so much more.  We will attempt to find other, more appropriate ways to recognize your outstanding contributions as we move into the holiday season. Ken Lay subject: Holiday Party - Canceled "
chairman.ken@enron.com,1,1,0.923,f16b2553-008f-4517-8845-7ffac2ed434b,"body: Today we released additional information about our related party and off-balance sheet transactions.  We have made this information available both on our website and in a Form 8-K filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The information provides further details about: 	-- the $1.2 billion charge to shareholders' equity announced in the third quarter and the transactions related to that charge; 	-- a restatement of prior years' financial statements to reflect this reduction in shareholders' equity, the consolidation of     three entities and prior year proposed audit adjustments and reclassifications; 	-- the Special Committee appointed by the Enron Board of Directors to review transactions between Enron and related parties;  	-- the LJM limited partnerships, including a discussion of transactions between Enron and LJM entities; and 	-- transactions between Enron and other Enron employees. This information addresses a number of concerns that have been raised by our shareholders and the SEC.  As our Board's new Special Committee continues its review of various matters, we will continue to cooperate fully with the SEC in its investigation, and we will continue to respond to investor requests so that they can evaluate, appreciate and appropriately value the strength of our core businesses.   Restatement of Earnings Based on information that we have recently obtained, Enron and its auditors determined that certain off-balance sheet entities should have been included in Enron's consolidated financial statements pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles.  As a result, Enron will restate its financial statements from 1997 to 2000 and for the first and second quarters of 2001.  These restatements have no material effect on Enron's current financial position.  Here are some details included in the filing: Net income for each period will be impacted by the retroactive consolidation of Joint Energy Development Investments (JEDI) and Chewco beginning in November 1997, the consolidation of an LJM1 subsidiary for 1999 and 2000 and prior year proposed audit adjustments.  Enron's current assessment indicates that the restatement will include: 	-- a reduction of approximately $96 million in 1997 	-- a reduction of approximately $113 million in 1998 	-- a reduction of approximately $250 million in 1999  	-- a reduction of approximately $132 million in 2000 	-- an increase of approximately $17 million for the first quarter of 2001  	-- an increase of approximately $5 million for the second quarter of 2001 	-- a reduction of $17 million for the third quarter of 2001.   The consolidation of JEDI and Chewco also will increase Enron's debt by approximately $711 million in 1997, $561 million in 1998, $685 million in 1999 and $628 million in 2000. The restatement will have no material impact on Enron's reported earnings for the nine-month period ending September 2001. You can obtain more detailed information on the items described above by accessing the Form 8-K filing at <http://www.enron.com/corp/sec/>. We will continue to review our strategic, operational and financial position, and we will continue to keep you updated on any developments. subject: SEC Information/Earnings Restatement "

bryant@cheatsheets.net,0,0,0.928,1a0a1da9-f3de-4066-aa4b-fb52c915b049,"body: Hi Folks, Our Footballguy Scott Luebke takes a look at this week's Upgrades, Downgrades and Waiver Wire Picks. Have a great week. Joe /**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/ Upgrades   By Scott Luebke QB - Brett Favre - Favre continues to prove why he is one of the greatest quarterbacks of all time.  Unlike the last few seasons, Favre remains healthy and continues to put up consistent fantasy numbers on a weekly basis.  With Bill Schroeder returning from an ankle injury, Favre's stock continues to rise. QB - Aaron Brooks - The inconsistent season of Aaron Brooks continues to excite and disappoint fantasy owners.  With 347 passing yards and 2 touchdowns (Williams dropped a third touchdown) against the 49ers, Brooks continues to be deemed a top 8 fantasy quarterback.  Keep him in your lineup and live with the ups and downs.  Brooks could put up explosive numbers during any game. QB - Donovan McNabb - McNabb continues to impress and should only get better with the development of his receiving crew.  With a favorable schedule for the remainder of the season, look for McNabb to carry fantasy teams towards the playoffs.  He has started to develop a quality connection with the speedy James Thrash.  Also, McNabb is starting to develop a good balance between staying in the pocket and scrambling for the first down.  Look for these extra rushing yards to provide added scoring as we head towards the fantasy playoffs. QB - Jay Fiedler - Fiedler has topped the 200 yard barrier in each of the last 4 games while finding the end zone 6 times.  With the development of talented rookie Chris Chambers, Fiedler has found a big play threat that should electrify the Miami offense.  With a favorable schedule for the remainder of the season, look for Fiedler to post solid numbers. QB - Jeff Garcia - Garcia has become a mainstay in the upgrades section. Add another 4 touchdowns to his total. RB - Marshall Faulk - He's back. RB - Fred Taylor - Taylor is nearing his return to the lineup.  He should be able to get a good tune up before the fantasy playoffs.  Let's hope he stays healthy. RB - Shaun Alexander - Wow!  266 rushing yards and 3 touchdowns make a good case to remain the starter upon Ricky Watters return from injury.  Will Holmgren be able to justify the benching of the team's running back of the future.  I mean...running back of the present.  Sorry Ricky, but your time appears up in Seattle. RB - Duce Staley - Staley scorched the Vikings for 231 total yards and a touchdown.  It appears that Staley is now at 100% health.  Keep in mind, Staley has always been a streaky producer throughout his career.  With the Eagles offense looking sharp, Staley will most likely have longer hot streaks than cold streaks. RB - Curtis Martin - Martin continues to look good on the season.  After being mired in a mini scoreless slump, Martin totaled 3 touchdowns against the Chiefs on Sunday.  With the winter weather approaching, quality running backs like Curtis Martin will become more important. RB - Dominic Rhodes - With Edgerrin James expected to miss the next 2 games and possibly the remainder of the season, Rhodes steps into the starting role.  Rhodes suffered a shoulder injury that forced him out of the first half on Sunday.  However, he was able to return in the second half.  Look for Rhodes to be a productive back in the second half of the season.  This upgrade is not based on production, but rather opportunity. RB - Jerome Bettis - The Bus continues to roll in yardage leagues, but he has been rather disappointing in scoring leagues.  With just two touchdowns on the season, basic scoring league owners must be frustrated with Bettis. Don't worry, Bettis will get a fair share of touchdowns in the second half of the season. RB - Mike Anderson - The knee injury to Terrell Davis will make Mike Anderson the team's starter once again. RB - Maurice Smith - Smith continues to look strong as the feature back for the Falcons.  Despite being held scoreless in the last 3 weeks, Smith continues to post quality yardage numbers (83, 84 and 148 yards).  When the Falcons become more efficient in the red zone with the passing game, Smith's touchdown numbers will increase. RB - Antowain Smith - 2 consecutive 100-yard games have Antowain Smith owners jumping for joy and this deserves an upgrade.  Heck, if Antowain Smith makes anyone jump for joy, it's gotta be good.  Heck, the Patriots offense is producing and the defense is maintaining quality field position. If the New England defense continues to play well and keep the Patriots in the lead, Smith will have a quality finish to the season. WR - Marvin Harrison - Harrison scorched the Dolphins for 174 yards and 3 touchdowns on Sunday.  With Edgerrin James likely out for the remainder of the season, Harrison and the passing game will become the focal point of the offense.  The return of Jerome Pathon should keep the pressure off of Harrison. WR - David Boston - 4 consecutive 100-yard receiving games and pure dominance at the wide receiver position.  Once again, I will proclaim Boston as the best young receiver in the game of football.  If the Arizona offense improves efficiency, Boston's touchdown numbers will rise dramatically. WR - Willie Jackson - ""Slick"" Willie appeared invisible for a few weeks, but Sunday's 11 catches for 167 yards deserves the upgrade.  Because of his effectiveness, look for Brooks to find Jackson more often.  In addition, Brooks appears to be showing signs of improvement and poise in the pocket. WR - Chris Chambers - Chambers showed his big play potential on Sunday and scored his first two touchdowns on the season.  Keep in mind, Chambers will most likely be an inconsistent choice at receiver for the remainder of this season.  However, he is a great option for dynasty or keeper leagues. WR - Bill Schroeder - Schroeder returned from an ankle injury and scored a touchdown in addition to his 100 yards receiving.  Before his injury, Schroeder was one of the most consistent producers at the wide receiver position.  Look for that trend to continue as long as he remains healthy. WR - Joe Horn - Horn has started to show signs of why he was drafted so high this season.  With games of 121, 83 and 99 yards, to go along with 4 touchdowns, Horn is making patient fantasy owners very happy.  Keep him in your lineup. WR - Terrell Owens - 100 yards receiving and 2 more touchdowns.  News flash...Owens is really good. WR - James Thrash - Thrash is assuming the role of #1 receiver in Philadelphia and that's a good thing with a quality talent like Donovan McNabb at quarterback. 2 more touchdowns on Sunday increase Thrash's total to 7 touchdowns on the season.  With Todd Pinkston struggling on the opposite side, McNabb continues to look in Thrash's direction more often. /**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/ Downgrades QB - Brian Griese - Griese has been looking good, but the ankle injury to Rod Smith has me worried a little bit.  Smith's ankle is something that needs to be watched, especially with Eddie Kennison claiming that he wants to retire.  If Rod Smith is unable to play, it may be wise to bench Griese, if you have a viable backup option. QB - Trent Green - Well, a healthy Derrick Alexander would have made this a better season for Green.  With two consecutive games held under 150 yards, Green once again is downgraded.  With a thin receiving crew at his disposal, Green will continue to be a shaky start.  If Alexander can return healthy after the bye week, Green could produce quality numbers down the stretch. For now, start someone else at quarterback. QB - Rob Johnson - A broken clavicle will keep Johnson out for 3-5 weeks. QB - Ryan Leaf - Leaf is not the answer to your fantasy team's problems.  If you're starting Ryan Leaf, your fantasy team must be really bad.  Time to play for next year, if you're in a keeper league. QB - Michael Vick - Vick remains a year or two away from becoming a viable fantasy quarterback option.  He continues to struggle with reading the defense.  On a good note, Vick threw for his first touchdown pass this past Sunday. RB - Edgerrin James - The knee injury to James appears to be more serious than first thought.  The knee injury will keep James out for another two weeks and possibly the remainder of the season.  Make sure you have Dominic Rhodes on your roster.  This is a big blow to Edgerrin James owners. RB - LaDainian Tomlinson - Tomlinson's struggles continue as opposing defenses have learned to shut down the Chargers running game.  After a glorious start to the season, Tomlinson has been on a gradual slide.  It's only a matter of time before Tomlinson returns to the upgrades list.  Don't bail out on Tomlinson just yet. RB - Terrell Davis - Davis injured his left knee on Sunday and will likely miss the next two games and possibly more. Davis will have arthroscopic knee and will miss Sunday's game against Washington and most likely the following week's game against Dallas. With the fragility of Davis lately, this is not a good sign. RB - Lamar Smith - Smith continues to struggle.  He has been held under 55 yards for the 4th consecutive week.  With Travis Minor starting to take a few carries away from Smith, Smith owners need to start worrying a little bit.  This week's game against the Jets could help signify the remainder of the season for Smith. RB - Travis Henry - Henry and the Bills running game continue to struggle. Henry has been held under 65 yards in each of the last 4 games.  Keep him on your bench until he begins to produce. WR - Muhsin Muhammad - Muhammad showed signs of life on Sunday with 75 yards receiving.  Keep in mind, the majority of this yardage was gained while the Rams held a commanding lead.  With Matt Lytle at quarterback, no Panthers receiver should be started. WR - Eric Moulds - 3 catches for 7 yards and an injury to the starting quarterback.  Moulds is currently sharing the title of most disappointing fantasy receiver with Randy Moss this season.  Yuck! WR - Darnay Scott - Scott suffered a concussion in Sunday's game against the Jaguars and was shut out on the day.  Concussions sometimes linger with receivers, so this deserves a little bit of watching.  He is expected to be ready for next week's game. WR - Rod Smith - Smith suffered an ankle injury in Sunday's game versus the Chargers.  It is not yet known whether the injury will keep Smith out of action, but it will most likely keep him from performing at his normal 100%. This situation bears watching.  Joe's email updates will keep you updated on this one. WR - Todd Pinkston - Pinkston continues to struggle and it may be only a matter of time before he loses the starting role to Freddie Mitchell.  If you are a Pinkston owner, it may be a wise decision to grab Mitchell, if you are in a deep league. /**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/ Waiver Wire Keep in mind, the waiver wire analysis selections are based off of 12 and 14 team leagues. QB - Alex Van Pelt - With Rob Johnson out for 3-5 weeks, Van Pelt will step in and be given a chance to perform.  Keep in mind, Van Pelt scorched the Jets for 268 yards and 3 touchdowns earlier this season.  He may be worth a shot. QB - Drew Bledsoe - Bledsoe has been cleared to play.  However, Tom Brady is expected to remain the starter.  Make sure you have Bledsoe on your team, if you have Brady. RB - Dominic Rhodes - The primary backup to the injured Edgerrin James. He will be a quality option for the remainder of the season in the Colts offense.  James' owners should already have Rhodes on their roster. RB - Travis Minor - Minor displayed his explosive running skills against Indianapolis on Sunday.  He's gradually taking a few carries away from Lamar Smith.  With Smith struggling, Minor could see his role expand.  Minor is very similar to Warrick Dunn. RB - LaMont Jordan - Jordan has gotten 17 carries in the last 2 weeks. Because of his effectiveness, he'll continue to see 5-10 carries per week. If Martin befalls injury, Jordan would be explosive. RB - Troy Hambrick - Hambrick continues to produce with the absence of Emmitt Smith.  It is not apparent how long Smith will be out of action, but Hambrick is a good option for right now. WR - Chris Chambers - Chambers showed his big play potential on Sunday and scored his first two touchdowns on the season.  Keep in mind, Chambers will most likely be an inconsistent choice at receiver for the remainder of this season.  However, he is a great option for dynasty or keeper leagues. WR - Keith Poole - With Rod Smith injured (ankle) and Eddie Kennison pondering retirement, the Broncos will need Poole to enter the starting lineup and produce.  Poole is not the flashiest receiver, but he has the ability to be productive in the Denver offense. WR - Freddie Mitchell - Mitchell continues to see more and more action in the Eagles offense and deserves consideration for a second half pickup. Grab him, especially if you are in a keeper league. WR - Jerome Pathon - Many fantasy owners dropped Pathon a few weeks ago, but he is healthy now.  With the loss of Edgerrin James in the Colts offense, look for the Colts to pass more often.  Pathon could be valuable down the stretch. /**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/ Bryant Analytics, Inc.

Cc:	Schoppe, Tammie; Brooks, Loretta; Lopez, Susan; Duree, Janelle Subject:	Move Related Issues As you all know, our move is scheduled for this weekend.  Hopefully,  you and your groups are all progressing well in your preparations for the move this Friday. Please take the time to read the information contained in this message because most of the information contains reminders or FYI items and will be important to you and your group.  Please forward this to those in your group that may need this information.   ?	Voicemail instructions - Please have everyone in your group clear all new voicemail messages by 5:00 PM, Friday, 11/16.  All saved messages, greetings and recorded names will be saved.  If a message is left before cutover the message will be saved, but the message light will not be displayed when you arrive.  As a precautionary meassure please check voice mail upon your arrival Monday morning even if the message light isn't on.   ?	Building access - ECS will not be available for general access until Monday morning at 5:00 AM.  Due to the gas and power moves being combined, it is unlikely that the move team will be prepared for the POC's to come in on Sunday to unpack.  (Separate instructions will be generated for those who are needed to test trading applications.)  NOTE: Only those whose names have been approved and submitted to security will be allowed access on Sunday. o	Monday - 5:00 AM for all employees ?	Security & badges -  All POC team members should be familiar with the routes into ECS as we discussed at our recent move meeting.  Please be sure to share this information with all of the people in your group.  If you need additional copies of the floor plans that have the access routes highlighted, please contact Carli Smith (5-3473). Please stress to everyone to have their badges with them at all times.  No one will be allowed access without their badge.  If anyone tries to access the building from the garage via the skyring and they do not have their badge, they will be sent back through the garage to the street level to walk across the street to the round kiosk in the Enron building lobby to get a guest pass and then proceed back to ECS via the 2nd floor and the skyring. ?	Move team colors - As mentioned at the move meeting, the following is a list of the color designations (vests) for the various teams that will be on the floor when we move in.   o	Red - Move Team o	Orange - Desktop Support/IT o	Green - Telephony ?	Newspaper subscriptions - The delivery location for all newspaper subscriptions need to be changed to ECS 05/06.  It is our intention to have all daily newspapers delivered to the mail desk located in the ECS 2nd floor corridor.  It will be the responsibility of the assistants to either pick up the papers for their group or designate someone in their group to pick up the papers.  If your papers continue to be delivered to your old floor of ECN, contact Sunny Rodgers (3-6116). ?	Move boxes -  Please encourage your group to pack and bring no more than about 6 boxes per person.  You may call Facilities (3-6300) if you need to request additional boxes. ?	Move labels -  If you run out of labels or if you are missing any labels, please call Carli Smith (5-3473) to have additional or missing labels printed. ?	Laptops - Important - Please ensure that all cable locks have been removed from all laptop computers by 5:00 PM on Friday.  If any cable locks are left on the computers they will be destroyed by the move team in order to move the computers as scheduled. .	Bottled water - Every kitchen has an ice machine that also dispenses filtered water.  The large bottles of water (5 gallon) will not be allowed on the floor.  We would also like   to discourage the use of small bottles of water due to limited storage space and the availability of filtered water at several locations.   ?	Phone sets - Although most of you are aware of this, we just wanted to remind you that there will be only one phone on each desk - either a turret or an Avaya, but not both.  Do not tag your phones, a new phone will be waiting for each person on their desk in the new building I hope I have covered some of the outstanding questions or issues you might have, but if I have missed something, please let me know.  Thanks so much for all your help and hard work. subject: FW: Additional Move Related Information "

bryant@cheatsheets.net,0,0,0.933,bf9057e9-86ef-482a-a2d0-ea5a80209435,"body: Hi Folks, Here's how I see the Passing Game Matchups this week. PLEASE NOTE:   See the cheatsheets online at www.footballguys.com  for exactly where I rank players and to determine who to start.   I always receive emails asking me how I can have a guy ranked highly on the cheatsheet but listed under a matchup that favors the Defense.   Just because one matchup may be more favorable than another, that doesn't necessarily mean I'd start the player with the best matchup.   Peyton Manning may have a horrible matchup one week but unless you're sitting on Kurt Warner or Daunte Culpepper, Manning's your guy no matter who he's lining up against.   The matchup info is meant to be just one more tool in your box when it comes to deciding between players. Note:  I've used the player stats sorted by performance over the last four weeks extensively in developing these write-ups. Stats are provided by Mike Hall's excellent FLM League Management Software.  http://www.fflm.com/ for more info.   The points scored by position data is from our Footballguy Clayton Gray.  The Target and Redzone Data is from our Footballguy Andy Hicks. Let's get to it. Joe /**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/ Passing Game Matchups to Avoid and Exploit Locks:  These games feature Defenses that should be overmatched against the Offense. Arizona Passing Game vs Detroit Defense If you're going to roll the dice on Jake Plummer, this is the week against the Lions who rank # 23 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   The Lions rank # 31 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 25 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.   WR David Boston is a bonafide All Pro and is worthy of starting in any league, even with Plummer. Denver Passing Game vs Washington Defense QB Brian Griese gets healthy and now finds himself with no WRs to throw to. Eddie Kennison suffered a brain cramp last week and retired / unretired / was cut.   He didn't contribute much anyways but with Rod Smith hobbled with an ankle injury, the Broncos are dangerously thin.   Smith says he'll play though.   TE Desmond Clark and Dwayne Carswell could see more action.   The Redskin defense is awful ranking # 31 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks so you have to like the matchup. Indianapolis Passing Game vs New Orleans Defense Peyton Manning looks like he'll be ready to go, broken jaw and all. They'll need him as Edgerrin James looks to be done for the year.   I'd expect you'll see Manning lean heavily on Marvin Harrison to carry the load. Jerome Pathon re-aggravated his foot and may not even play this week. Reggie Wayne and Terrence Wilkins will be the other WRs.   New Orleans ranks # 29 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks so they're very beatable.   For the year, they rank # 20 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 23 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs. New Orleans Passing Game vs Indianapolis Defense QB Aaron Brooks finally played like we all were expecting last week.   With 347 yards and 2 TDs (plus another sure TD dropped by Ricky Williams), let's hope this is what Brooks needed to get going.   WRs Joe Horn and Willie Jackson looked great and should continue to roll.   Indianapolis ranks # 28 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks so they shouldn't present too much of a problem. New York Giants Passing Game vs Minnesota Defense QB Kerry Collins will likely be thinking of last year's NFC Championship game where he toasted the Vikings.   It could happen again as the Giants are rolling while Minnesota is struggling.   WRs Amani Toomer, Ike Hilliard and Joe Jurevicius will see action.   The Giants are a run first team but that opens the pass as teams focus on stopping Ron Dayne and Tiki Barber.   The Vikings rank # 21 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks. San Francisco Passing Game vs Carolina Defense QB Jeff Garcia and WR Terrell Owens are no brainer starts against the AFC Pro Bowl Team so I think they'll probably warrant starts against the Panther defense that ranks # 26 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   WR Tai Streets is worth a gamble as is our favorite Yale grad, TE Eric Johnson.   Greg Clark hasn't been healthy in years it seems. /**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/ Prime Matchups:  These games feature Defenses that should have trouble stopping the Offense. Baltimore Passing Game vs Cleveland Defense Elvis Grbac looks to be taking a step backwards as he looked uncomfortable in the pocket last week.   Look for the Ravens to run the ball to take pressure off the passing game.   This is a good matchup for Baltimore as the Browns rank # 25 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks. Qadry Ismail was the big WR last week with 129 yards and a TD.   Brandon Stokely is in the WR mix as well as the up and down Travis Taylor.   TE Shannon Sharpe is always a threat. Cincinnati Passing Game vs Tennessee Defense The strength of this team is Corey Dillon and running the ball.   Kitna threw 48 passes last week and that won't continue.   With T.J. Houshmandzadeh becoming a factor, the Bengals are getting back to the 3 WR sets that were effective before Chad Johnson was injured.   That's a big plus.   The Titans rank # 30 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks so they're definitely vulnerable.   For the year, Tennessee ranks # 27 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 30 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs. Detroit Passing Game vs Arizona Defense Charlie Batch is throwing the ball a lot and that's just fine for his owners.   The problem is he doesn't have many guys who can catch it. Lamont Warren and Corey Schlesinger caught more passes than WR Johnnie Morton last week.   That needs to change.   The Cardinals rank # 11 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks but they're not that good.   For the year, they rank # 23 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 21 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs. Green Bay Passing Game vs Atlanta Defense Favre's playing as well as ever.   Start him.  I'd start both Antonio Freeman and Billy Schroeder as well.   Having Schroeder back clearly is a big plus for Favre.   TE Bubba Franks is always worth a shot as well.   The Falcons rank # 10 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks so they're no pushover.   Although that's an improvement from where the Falcons have been.   For the year, they still rank # 30 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 31 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.   I'd feel good about all the Packers here. Oakland Passing Game vs San Diego Defense Rich Gannon put together another solid game throwing for 257 yards and 2 TDs.   With guys like Tim Brown and Jerry Rice to throw to, that doesn't hurt your chances.   He'll be facing a Charger Defense that's struggled a bit and now ranks # 20 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   Safety Rodney Harrison will likely miss this week and that hurts. Pittsburgh Passing Game vs Jacksonville Defense This team is about Jerome Bettis and running the football but part of Bettis' success has to be attributed to the revival of the passing game. Stewart offers enough of a threat that defenses must honor the pass.   Hines Ward is productive but he's about the only player from the passing game I can see starting in your league.   It is enticing this week though as the Jaguars rank just # 24 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks. St. Louis Passing Game vs New England Defense QB Kurt Warner's thumb responded well to treatment this week and looks good to go.   That's bad news for Patriot fans.   The New England Defense ranks # 19 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   Isaac Bruce and Torry Holt are must starts every week even against a giant killer team like New England.   Marshall Faulk is back in full swing and he'll be a major part of the passing game again. Tampa Bay Passing Game vs Chicago Defense QB Brad Johnson is starting to feel the comfort zone it seems although he's still dinking and dunking the ball (5.22 yards per attempt last week)   It's basically Johnson (Brad) throwing to Johnson (Keyshawn)   The Bears are not nearly as tough defending the pass as they are the run.   They rank # 27 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   Could be a good matchup. /**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/ Even Matchups:  These games feature no real advantage either way Buffalo Passing Game vs Seattle Defense Alex Van Pelt takes over and that could be a spark the Bills need.   WRs Peerless Price and Eric Moulds should be more involved.   Or on the other hand, maybe we'll find Rob Johnson wasn't as bad as his OL made him look. We'll see.   Van Pelt probably isn't a starting QB anywhere (his last start was in 1997) but he might be worth a shot if you're desperate.   Seattle is an average defense ranked # 12 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   But for the year, they rank # 29 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 24 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs. Cleveland Passing Game vs Baltimore Defense QB Tim Couch spread the offense out to beat Baltimore earlier this year and I'd look for them to employ a similar tactic this week.   He's steady.   WR Kevin Johnson is clearly still his primary target.   The Ravens are tough on the run defense but rank # 22 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 12 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 10 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.   Tough matchup but don't count out Couch. Dallas Passing Game vs Philadelphia Defense Leaf started his Dallas career with an unremarkable 14 of 22 for 114 yard day.   1 TD and 1 Int.   I guess it could have been worse.   He'll have another week of practice under the belt.   The Eagles are pretty average lately on defense ranking # 13 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they're tough though ranking # 3 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 4 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.   This doesn't look promising for Leaf or WRs Joey Galloway / Raghib Ismail although both are big play guys and it only takes a few seconds for them to make your weekend.   They will have a speed advantage over the more physical Eagle Corners. New York Jets Passing Game vs Miami Defense Vinnie Testeverde looks to have his exciting rookie WR, Santana Moss available for his debut game this week.   Could be interesting as Dolphin Cornerback Sam Madison is injured and Moss could make things interesting if the Jets turn him loose.   Wayne Chrebet may be limited with a bad shoulder. Laveranues Coles has been up and down.   The Dolphins rank # 14 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks but clearly, will miss Madison. Philadelphia Passing Game vs Dallas Defense Donovan McNabb continues his outstanding play.   WR James Thrash has clearly identified himself as the prime WR over Todd Pinkston.   Young Freddie Mitchell is coming on strong too.   The Cowboys are pretty tough on defense ranking # 7 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks. Although for the year, they rank # 19 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 19 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.   This team may decide to keep it on the ground though given the huge success they had running the ball last week with Duce Staley and Correll Buckhalter. Tennessee Passing Game vs Cincinnati Defense Steve McNair sat out of Thursday's practice nursing his bad hand.   His status for Sunday isn't clear yet.   Although he's normally a question mark each week.   His # 1 target, TE Frank Wycheck is hobbling too with an ankle but hopes to be ready by Sunday.   WRs Kevin Dyson and Derrick Mason are playing well lately.   The Bengals are average ranking # 15 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 24 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 22 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.   K eep an eye on McNair's hand here. Washington Passing Game vs Denver Defense I'll admit to being surprised at the success Tony Banks has had but you have to give the guy his due.   He's stretching the defenses and making good reads.   And WRs Michael Westbrook and Rod Gardner seem to play hard for him.   They'll face a Denver Defense ranked # 16 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   Denver held Doug Flutie in check last week so that's some worry.   TE Stephen is still looking very iffy for Sunday. /**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/ Downside Matchups:  These games feature a Defense that could pose trouble for the Offense. Atlanta Passing Game vs Green Bay Defense QB Chris Chandler was able to practice Thursday and that's great news.   The Falcons struggled without him.   WR Shawn Jefferson led all receivers last week - with 2 catches.   Ouch.   Hopefully, with Chandler back, Jefferson, Terence Mathis and Tony Martin will do better.   On the flip side, Chandler is his usual one shot away from the bench.   It won't be easy though against a tough Packer defense that ranks # 8 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks. Carolina Passing Game vs San Francisco Defense Ugliness all around here.   George Seifert has to look across at those 49er uniforms and wonder how it came to this.   QB Chris Weinke is reportedly looking pretty good in practice but coach Seifert was reluctant to name him the starter.   If he can't go, Matt Lytle will start.   WR Muhsin Muhammad and TE Wesley Walls are maybe worth the gamble but their stock is certainly slipping with the QB play.   San Francisco is ranked # 18 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks. Chicago Passing Game vs Tampa Bay Defense Look for QB Jim Miller to keep it pretty conservative in the passing scheme. Tampa ranks # 5 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks. The Bears want to run Anthony Thomas and throw enough to keep the Bucs off balance.   When they do throw, look for multiple WR sets as they work rookie David Terrell into the mix with Marty Booker and Dez White. Minnesota Passing Game vs New York Giants Defense With the Vikings running game in disarray, look for them to air it out against a tough New York Defense.   QB Daunte Culpepper will have his work cut out for him against the Giant defense ranked # 6 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   Like Kerry Collins, you can bet he'll be thinking of the NFC Championship game from a year ago where his team fell apart.   Randy Moss and Cris Carter are starters in most leagues just on potential alone.   TE Byron Chamberlain could be a factor as well. New England Passing Game vs St. Louis Defense QB Drew Bledsoe proclaimed himself ready to start but Tom Brady gets the nod again this week.   No promises for next week but it'll be hard to keep Bledsoe's salary on the bench.   We'll see.   Brady's been solid.   WRs Troy Brown and David Patten need to re-engage and become a bigger part of the offense.   The Rams are tough ranking # 4 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks. San Diego Passing Game vs Oakland Defense Is the ""Flutie Magic"" wearing off?   He certainly looked mortal last week. This week, he'll be without TE Freddie Jones.   Even though Jones wasn't being utilized much, he was still a nice outlet.   Tim Dwight is still out with a collapsed lung so that leaves WRs Curtis Conway and Jeff Graham to carry the load.   Both are capable.   Oakland's Charles Woodson may be limited with a bad foot and that'll help.   The Raiders rank # # 9 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   They rank # 21in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 12 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs. Seattle Passing Game vs Buffalo Defense Matt Hasselbeck offered a glimmer of hope last week and hopes to build on that success.   As long as Shaun Alexander is running wild, Hasselbeck certainly has a chance with the play action pass.   Darrell Jackson in particular is looking better and Koren Robinson will work against a tough set of Cornerbacks.   The Bills rank # 2 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks and have 16 sacks over the last 4 games so this will be no cakewalk. /**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/ Defensive Slam Dunks:  These games feature a very tough Defense posing major problems for the Offense. Jacksonville Passing Game vs Pittsburgh Defense Mark Brunell and crew will have their work cut out for them as they face a much better Steeler team than they saw in week 1.   The Steelers rank # 3 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.  WRs Jimmy Smith and Keenan McCardell both scored last week and continue to put up quality numbers.   The Steelers will throw Cornerbacks Dewayne Washington and Chad Scott who are very solid.   Plus, the defense has recorded 23 sacks over the last 4 weeks.   Tough matchup. Miami Passing Game vs New York Jets Defense QB Jay Fiedler quietly put a very nice game together last week with 259 yards and 2 TDs.   His WRs are solid and our guy Chris Chambers had a breakout game with 2 TDs.   Oronde Gadsden is quietly putting together a nice season.   The Jets rank # 1 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks though so it'll likely be tough.   They rank # 4 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs for the year and # 8 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs. I'd look for the Dolphins to try and exploit their much softer run defense. /**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/ Bryant Analytics, Inc.

Joe /**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/ Rushing Game Matchups Locks:  These games feature Defenses that should be overmatched against the Offense. Baltimore's Jason Brookins vs Cleveland Defense With Terry Allen out, Jason Brookins gets the starting nod.   He fared pretty well against the Titans Monday with 57 yards on 14 carries (4.1 ypc) The Browns run defense is soft ranking just # 28 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks.   With QB Elvis Grbac looking a little shaky in his return, I'd expect you'll see Brookins pound the ball against a weak run defense. Green Bay's Ahman Green vs Atlanta Defense Green rolled for 93 yards on 18 carries (5.2 ypc) last week against a nasty Chicago run defense.   This week he faces a soft Falcon defense that ranks # 24 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks.   Start Green... New York Giant's Ron Dayne / Tiki Barber vs Minnesota Defense With their outstanding running game last week, look for the Giants to continue rolling on the ground.   Both Dayne and Barber had 3 Red Zone touches last week.   Barber could be more effective in this game as he takes advantage of the fast track in the Metrodome.   Minnesota is awful defending the run ranking # 31 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks.   They rank # 30 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.   I'd feel good starting either one of these guys. San Francisco's Garrison Hearst / Kevan Barlow vs Carolina Defense Hearst ran wild last week totaling 145 yards on 17 carries (8.5 ypc) Coupled with the Jeff Garcie / Terrell Owens tandem, that's a pretty tough offense.   Things look even better this week against an awful Carolina defense ranked # 29 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 28 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs. Kevan Barlow will stay #2 as long as Hearst continues to put up numbers like this.   Plus, Barlow is slowed with a quad injury.   Looks like a great matchup for Hearst. St. Louis' Marshall Faulk vs New England Defense I'm not going to insult your intelligence.   Start Marshall Faulk. /**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/ Prime Matchups:  These games feature Defenses that should have trouble stopping the Offense. Arizona's Michael Pittman vs Detroit Defense Pittman started to get back on track a bit last week with 54 yards on 17 carries (3.2 ypc)   He'll face a soft Lion defense this week that ranks # 27 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 25 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.   Pittman should find room to run if QB Jake Plummer and WR David Boston can soften the defense just a little. Chicago's Anthony Thomas vs Tampa Bay Defense After a strong start last week against the tough Packer Defense, Anthony Thomas was shut down.   He'll face a Tampa defense this week that's bark is worse than it's bite.   They talk pretty big but only rank # 20 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks.   They rank # 17 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.   We'll see what kind of resiliency Thomas has and if he can get back on track.   Lots will depend on the Bear passing attack and if Jim Miller can throw downfield enough to loosen the safeties. Detroit's Rueben Droughns / Corey Schlesinger vs Arizona Defense It's an interesting matchup here.   James Stewart is out again and the combo of Droughns and Schlesinger will run the ball.   Droughns totaled just 30 yard on 13 carries last week (2.3 ypc)   Even worse, was Schlesinger who managed just 13 yards on 7 carries (1.9 ypc)   On the upside, both managed a TD and both were very active in the Red Zone.   This week, they'll face a weak Arizona defense that ranks # 25 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks and # 22 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.   If you've been thinking about starting a Lion RB, now's your chance. Miami's Lamar Smith / Travis Minor vs New York Jets Defense Lamar Smith has me worried a bit as he continues to look less than stellar while Travis Minor slashes up the defense.   Smith had 53 yards on 18 carries (2.9 ypc) Sunday while Minor ripped off 71 yards on just 7 carries (10.1 ypc)   The good news is that the Jets run defense is still pretty bad. They've improved recently but still rank # 23 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 26 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.   If you've been starting Smith, I'd stick with him for at least this game.   He did have 2 red zone rushes last week while Minor had none.   If you're in the gambling mood, I might roll the dice with Minor. New Orleans' Ricky Williams vs Indianapolis Defense Williams rolled up a monster yardage day against the 49ers last week with 121 yards on 24 carries (5.0 ypc) and added 52 yards receiving to it.   And it should have been better as he dropped a sure TD in the endzone that hit him right in the hands.   Needless to say, he's rolling.   He'll be facing a very average Indy defense that ranks # 14 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks.   Although the Colts will be without their best defensive player, OLB Mike Peterson.   The Saints also hope to have All Pro Offensive Lineman Willie Roaf back in action which will make the running game even more formidable. Oakland's Charlie Garner / Zack Crockett vs San Diego Defense Charlie Garner continues to run the ball between the 20's while Zack Crockett gets the scores.   Garner had 57 yards on 13 carries (4.4 ypc) last week but Crockett was the one with 2 TDs.   I don't see that changing much. Especially with Tyrone Wheatley due back any time.   The Charger defense is average ranking # 21 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks. San Diego's LaDainian Tomlinson vs Oakland Defense Look for Tomlinson to try and pull a Shaun Alexander who ran wild over the Oakland defense last week.   I'm guessing you'll see the Raiders stiffen a bit.   Tomlinson ran well last week but simply didn't get enough carries (14 carries for 75 yards - 5.4 ypc)   Doug Flutie is starting to look very vulnerable and the Chargers need to get back to Tomlinson and the ground game.   With the awful performance last week, the Raider defense falls from # 11 to # 30 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks. It'll be interesting to see how they respond. Seattle's Shaun Alexander vs Buffalo Defense Alexander tallied 266 rushing yards and 3 TDs against a good Oakland defense last week.   You have to start Alexander against the Bills that rank # 19 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks. /**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/ Even Matchups:  These games feature no real advantage either way Buffalo's Travis Henry vs Seattle Defense Travis Henry's running hard, he just isn't being given a lot of opportunities in this offense.   He totaled 51 yards on 16 carries (3.2 ypc) last week.   I'm not sure any RB would do a lot behind that Offensive Line though.   He faces a Seattle defense that ranks # 22 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks.   They rank # 11 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs so they're pretty tough.   The Linebacking Corps with Levon Kirkland could cause some trouble.   Although new QB Alex Van Pelt could give the team a spark. Cincinnati's Corey Dillon vs Tennessee Defense Dillon should move back to the focus of this offense as the Bengals realize Jon Kitna isn't a guy that should try to carry this team.   The trouble will be that Tennessee defends the run very well ranking # 4 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks.   They've come on lately as for the year, they rank # 21 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.   Like the Bengals, Tennesse's Defensive Ends are undersized and that could be trouble for a power running RB like Dillon. Philadelphia's Duce Staley / Correll Buckhalter vs Dallas Defense Looks to me like Duce Staley is back after a great day totaling 146 yards on 17 carries (8.6 ypc) with a TD.   Correll Buckhalter was active too with 66 yards on 11 carries (6.6 ypc) and a TD.   Part of that was the Viking Defense but you have to give credit to the Eagles.   This week, they'll face a Dallas team that's ranked # 11 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks.   I like their chances to keep it rolling.   I like Buckhalter but I think you'll continue to see Staley garner more and more time. Pittsburgh's Jerome Bettis vs Jacksonville Defense Jacksonville is decent against the run ranking # 12 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks but Jerome Bettis is pretty much a must start.   He's rolling and this offense is heavily dependent on him to carry the load.   QB Kordell Stewart and WR Hines Ward have improved enough to keep the Defense at least somewhat honest and Bettis does the rest. Tennessee's Eddie George vs Cincinnati Defense Even with Coach Jeff Fisher letting QB Steve McNair run the ball at the end of last week's wild Monday Night game, it's clear that Eddie George is getting stronger.   It's also clear that Cincinnati is getting weaker on defense.   Last week, they ranked # 9, this week they're down to # 18 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks.   The Bengals are undersized on the Defensive Line, especially at Defensive End and this could be a nice matchup for the powerful George. Washington's Stephen Davis vs Denver Defense Davis is finally starting to pay some dividends for his patient owners rushing for 142 yards on 32 carries (4.4 ypc) in his last game.   He's rested after a bye and should be able to keep the roll going against a Denver Defense that ranks # 13 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks.   Last week, the Broncos yielded 75 yards to LaDainian Tomlinson on just 14 carries (5.4 ypc)   The improvement of Stephen Davis can be tied directly to the better play of QB Tony Banks and his WRs. Teams can't stack the line now as they have to respect the deep ball. /**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/ Downside Matchups:  These games feature a Defense that could pose trouble for the Offense. Atlanta's Maurice Smith vs Green Bay Defense Maurice Smith rolled for 148 yards on 27 carries last week against a Cowboy defense that doesn't allow much on the ground.   He'll face a tougher defense in Green Bay this week that's ranked # 8 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks.   Although if you watched the Chicago - Green Bay game last week, you saw Anthony Thomas have great success early in the game running right at the Packer defense.   The Falcons are feeling more comfortable with Smith and I'd look for them to do the same thing.   Not a great matchup here but one I'd not be particularly afraid of if I'm a Smith owner. Dallas' Troy Hambrick / Emmitt Smith vs Philadelphia Defense Hambrick's coming off a great week where he rushed for 127 yards on 20 carries (6.3 ypc) against a suspect Falcon Defense.   He'll face a pretty good Eagle team ranked # 9 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks.   Emmitt Smith practiced late this week and could play but with Hambrick playing well, I doubt you'll see him rushed back.   Keep an eye on Hambrick - although he's expected to play, he's nursing a pretty serious shoulder injury himself. Denver's Mike Anderson / Olandis Gary vs Washington Defense As the Terrell Davis Saga takes another turn (downward), the Broncos turn once again to Mike Anderson and Olandis Gary.   They'll be ready.   The trouble I think is that the WR corps are limping (Rod Smith) and goofy (Eddie Kennison)   Kennison is gone and Smith's ankle looks like something that'll hopefully allow him to play but you don't know how much he'll be limited.   Smith has been their offensive focus and if he can't go, the running game will be affected.   To make it worse, Washington has been surprisingly tough against the run lately ranking # 3 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks.   Primarily because they rank # 31 in Passing Yards Allowed over that same span but that doesn't really matter.   Teams clearly feel they can throw against Washington.   Although with Smith less than 100%, this might not be the case for Denver.   All in all, not a great matchup.   ESPNews was reporting Thursday night that Olandis Gary could possibly get the start.   Welcome to Shannyland...   See how this shakes out as right now, it's looking very murky. Indianapolis Dominic Rhodes vs New Orleans Defense Dominic Rhodes had a nice game in week 8 where he rushed for 100 yards on 34 carries (2.9 ypc)   He found the going tougher last week with just 42 yards on 14 carries (3.0 ypc)   Plus he injured his shoulder.   The yards per carry numbers are disturbing.   On the plus side, Edgerrin James is out for at least a while and maybe the season so Rhodes is the man.   New Orleans plays a decent run defense ranking # 17 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks.   They rank # 12 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs. QB Peyton Manning has a broken jaw but says he'll play.   NOTE:   ESPN is reporting now that the 2nd opinion on Edgerrin James' knee was no better than the first and that he looks to definitely be done for the year. New England's Antowain Smith vs St. Louis Defense Antowain Smith had to enjoy his game last week against his old team where he rushed for 100 yards on 20 carries (5.0 ypc) and 2 TDs.   I doubt he'll have the same success against the Rams who rank # 5 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks. New York Jet's Curtis Martin vs Miami Defense It's still all about Curtis Martin in this new West Coast offense which looks a lot like the old Curtis Martin Offense.   Martin's coming off a monster day where he rushed for 113 yards on 20 carries (5.7 ypc) and 3 TDs. He'll face a solid Defense this week in Miami.   They rank # 6 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks and # 8 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.   Martin is one of the few RBs to have a lot of success against Miami.   Look for the Jets to ask him to do it again this week. /**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/ Defensive Slam Dunks:  These games feature a very tough Defense posing major problems for the Offense. Carolina's Richard Huntley / Nick Goings vs San Francisco Defense This is U-G-L-Y   Goings was the leading rusher last week with 13 yards on 9 carries (1.4 ypc)   Huntley's done very little with his golden opportunity to start (7 yards on 6 carries last week)   I'd avoid all Panthers here. Cleveland's James Jackson vs Baltimore Defense James Jackson played a gutsy game last week against a tough Pittsburgh defense gaining 57 yards on 18 carries (3.2 ypc)   It won't get any easier this week against the Ravens who rank # 7 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks and rank # 1 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs. MLB Ray Lewis continues to be a terrific run stopper along with the DTs Tony Siragusa and Sam Adams.   Back in week 6, Jackson did run for 77 yards and a TD so it's no sure thing he'll not produce - it's just a tough matchup. Jacksonville's Stacey Mack / Fred Taylor vs Pittsburgh Defense The question of the week is whether Taylor can play or not.   He's set to practice this week but it's still not clear how much (if any) he'll be able to go.   Watch this one closely.   Obviously, his chances are much better than Mack's although Mack has shown a nose for the endzone and finally seems to be earning some points with Coach Coughlin.   Whoever runs the ball will have a tough day as Pittsburgh ranks # 1 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks.   They rank # 4 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs for the year.   Unless Taylor looks great late this week and you're out of other options, I'd look elsewhere. Minnesota's Doug Chapman / Michael Bennett vs New York Giants Defense Michael Bennett will likely play although we're hearing Chapman will start. I'm not excited about either against a tough New York Defense ranked # 10 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks.   They rank # 2 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.   I'm guessing both will play and neither will do a lot. Tampa Bay's Mike Alstott / Warrick Dunn vs Chicago Defense Good luck figuring this running game out.   In week 8, it was Alstott with all the Red Zone touches (2 rushes, 1 pass target - 1 TD)  Last week it was Dunn in the Red Zone (3 rushes, 1 pass target - 1 TD)   Go figure.   This week, they'll face a tough Chicago defense still smarting from Ahman Green. The Bears rank # 2 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks and I don't think I'd want to be catching this week. /**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/ That'll do it for the Rushing Matchups.

bryant@cheatsheets.net,0,0,0.932,85f78b69-8ec2-4d6f-9482-75d4509a2088,"body: Hi Folks, Here's our first cut at this week's cheatsheet rankings.   As always, we'll keep them updated online www.footballguys.com as this late in the season, there are lots of injury situations that need watching.   I've included the status of the players that made the Official Injury Report and listed them as they appear there.   Keep in mind that teams like Tennessee hardly ever give accurate information.   (Denver runs a distant second)   A Titan ""Questionable"" is most definitely not the same as a Jet ""Questionable"". Stay tuned through the week as these shake out. I've also included Tom Nadratowski's Individual Defensive Rankings for this week. Best of luck and I hope all the bounces go your way.

bryant@cheatsheets.net,0,0,0.932,78002633-e267-4619-adf8-f95cbcad01e4,"body: Entire story: http://www.uniontrib.com/sports/chargers/20011114-9999_1s14chargers.html Add tight end Freddie Jones to the list of Chargers who won't play Sunday at Oakland. Jones traveled to Columbia, S.C., yesterday to get a second opinion on an injured ankle that has limited him to one practice in the past three weeks. Although the results of the MRI exam won't be determined until today, a source close to the situation said Dr. Evan Ekman of Southern Orthopedic Sports Medicine has advised Jones against playing against the Raiders. The timing couldn't be worse for the Chargers, who have lost two in a row and four of six to fall to 5-4. They already will be without strong safety Rodney Harrison, special teams standout Carlos Polk and nickel cornerback Alex Molden because of injuries, and losing Jones will restrict offensive coordindator Norv Turner's ability to run two-tight end formations. The Chargers have just two other tight ends on the roster, and neither presents the threat Jones does. Steve Heiden has just four receptions this season and 10 in his career, and Josh Whitman is a receptionless rookie who was promoted off the practice squad last month, after being waived by Buffalo. Jones was voted the team's offensive MVP last season after he led the club with a career-high 71 catches and tied for the team lead with five touchdown receptions. He was supposed to build on that this season under Turner, but a bad ankle sprain suffered Oct. 21 against Denver changed that. Through nine games, Jones has just 19 catches -- 17 fewer than team leader Curtis Conway and just three more than rookie running back LaDainian Tomlinson. Jones has participated in only one practice since sustaining the injury, but the Chargers kept him in the lineup by providing pain-killing shots to the ankle on Sunday. Jones, who could not be reached for comment, has not missed a game since his rookie year in 1997. He had started 53 straight games before the Chargers opened with a tight end-less formation against Denver on Oct. 21. But spread formations were not the reason Jones didn't start in two of the past three games; the ankle was. Last week in particular, the Chargers tried to limit him to two-tight end sets and occasional spread formations. The hope was that they could limit the wear and tear on him while still getting the big play, such as two weeks ago when Jones caught a fourth-quarter touchdown pass against the Chiefs. His three scoring receptions are tied for the team lead with Conway. But it has gotten to the point that Jones' condition was worsening instead of improving. Some close to him fear the injury could become chronic and arthritic if Jones doesn't treat it properly now. Which means rest and rehab -- especially on Sunday. General manager John Butler said late yesterday afternoon that he had yet to receive word on Jones' status. ""Anytime someone wants a second opinion, he's sure welcome to it,"" Butler said. ""What else can you do? I don't know what the second opinion is going to show. Our doctors have done their work. ""You're always concerned when somebody's not feeling their best, so we'll see if there's something detected that our people didn't see."" [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [  OUR VIEW  ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] Clearly bad news for Jones and also for Doug Flutie.   San Diego isn't a real high profile team so it's not talked about a lot but Jones is a guy they'd love to be the primary focus.   When healthy, he's that good.   You'd have to think Curtis Conway and Jeff Graham will see a little more action although Jones hasn't been much of a factor lately already.   Few people think Steve Heiden is the answer there.   You may be able to grab an available TE in your league if some owners have slacked off.   San Francisco's Eric Johnson is a guy we've liked for a while that's starting to emerge and might be around in smaller leagues. Thanks to Footballguy Scott Hensell for pointing me to this one.

Although these  jitters have led to higher early-November prices, the winter market looks to be  well supplied owing to the combination of milder weather, depressed demand,  high storage levels, and ample production. December Henry Hub prices are  expected to average $2.70 per MMBtu. * US gas storage inventories are estimated to leveled off at 3,107 billion  cubic feet (Bcf) by the end of October. Without harsher weather, the year-over- year storage surplus should swell to over 770 Bcf by end-December. * December demand will be significantly lower than in 2000 due largely to the  milder weather expected this year. While some industrial demand will return due  to lower gas prices, overall demand should be 11 percent lower than last year. **end** Follow above URL for complete CERA Monthly Briefing (6 printed pages).

Team president Bill Polian said Monday night that Pathon will undergo surgery ``sometime soon'' to repair a damaged ligament in his right foot. The move will end Pathon's fourth NFL season. The Colts did not announce how they would fill Pathon's roster spot. Pathon sprained his right foot near the end of the third game of the season, a 44-13 loss at New England. He aggravated the injury during warmups before the Colts played Miami on Nov. 11. Polian said a further examination last week revealed more damage to the foot. Pathon earned the starting job opposite two-time Pro Bowl receiver Marvin Harrison, and was having the best season of his career. He set career highs for receptions and receiving yards in each of the Colts' first two games, and was the team's leading receiver through three games. He missed four games before returning against Miami. Pathon tried to practice last Wednesday. But Polian said the receiver had a setback before missing Sunday's game at New Orleans. Pathon finishes the season with 24 receptions for 330 yards and two touchdowns. [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [  OUR VIEW  ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] And the hits just keep on rollin' for Indy.   Terrence Wilkins and Reggie Wayne should benefit as should TE Marcus Pollard.   Tough break for Pathon who was having a great start. Thanks to Footballguy Chuck Bailey for pointing me to this one.

bryant@cheatsheets.net,0,0,0.94,40740f56-0713-43b3-a8bb-90c7cf2be899,"body: Entire story: http://www.sportsline.com/u/ce/multi/0,1329,4560008_59,00.html Clipped from the Jay Glazer article on CBS Sportsline: One week after Miami-based specialist Dr. John Uribe recommended that Colts' running back Edgerrin James undergo season-ending knee surgery, the doctor recommended that another star back is not yet ready to return to action. SportsLine.com has learned that Jaguars running back Fred Taylor met with the specialist Tuesday morning and was told that his injured groin is still not healed. Taylor has been practicing the past three weeks and the Jaguars had hoped he would have been back in the lineup already. However, he has been unable to run full speed and now comes word that he will continue be sidelined. ""Dr. Uribe said he has a major injury and that after eight weeks, it's still not healed and is going to take some more time getting healthy,"" Taylor's agent Drew Rosenhaus said. ""He wasn't sure specifically how much time Fred would miss but it's a major tear, he tore the groin muscle off the bone. Dr. Uribe said this is the type of injury that could often take a minimum of three months before it is healed."" Taylor injured the groin in the first half of the team's second game of the year. He made a cut in the middle of the field and suddenly stopped, let go of the ball and dropped. ""It's going to be very unfair for anyone to assume he will play any time in the immediate future,"" said Rosenhaus. ""He's just not healthy yet. He can't run full speed without tremendous pain. The Jaguars have done a very good job in working him but he's still in pain. ""It's not just the groin but he also has pain in the hip now, which is an off-shoot of the groin. But he's still healing and he shouldn't play at this time and when the Jaguars talk to him later today, I'm sure they'll have the same feeling."" In Taylor's absence, the Jaguars have played musical chairs in the backfield. Stacey Mack has been the primary replacement, but youngsters Frank Moreau and Elvis Joseph have also been given shots. Mack started Sunday's game and will likely remain with the first team in the immediate future. ""He's doing everything he can to get back in as soon as possible,"" said the Florida-based agent. ""Remember, we entered the season primed to play and receive a big contract extension so nobody wants in there more than Fred. ""But the doctor recommends that he is progressing at a good pace and it depends on how the injury heals. He said he has seen guys miss an entire season with this. But at the same time, it's such a vague injury. Fred may wake up next week and suddenly feel great. At the same time, it could take several weeks. We don't know. We only know he's healing but shouldn't play at this time."" [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [  OUR VIEW  ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] This makes sense as the Jaguars have been very vague about Taylor's health. Clearly, bad news for Taylor owners.   Stacey Mack and Elvis Joseph get an extension but they've come up pretty small so far.   As Dr. Coshal, our Footballguys.com Team Doc mentioned way back when Taylor was injured, this is a serious deal.   Stay tuned but for now it's not looking good. Thanks to Footballguy Jeff White for pointing me to this one. Joe /**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/ Bryant Analytics, Inc.

He decided about two hours before last Sunday's kickoff that he couldn't play against Pittsburgh due to a strained right quadriceps.

He suffered the injury Nov. 11, and aggravated it during Sunday's game. You should probably play it safe and keep Smith on your bench for this week.

We must adapt our employee programs to fit the immediate needs of our company during this time of transition.  It is especially difficult to announce the immediate suspension of the following programs. ?	ClickAtHome - Enron has suspended the ClickAtHome program.  The program will no longer accept new participants, PC orders, or Internet service orders.  Orders submitted and confirmed prior to November 20, 2001 will be honored.  Enron will also discontinue subsidized Internet service.  Effective January 1, 2002, employees who are currently subscribers to subsidized Internet service will be switched to the regular commercial rate of their service provider and be responsible for the entire cost of the service. ?	Matching Gifts and Volunteer Incentive Program (VIP) - Enron's Matching Gift program and VIP grants have been suspended indefinitely.  As we consider the immediate needs of all employees during this trying time, it is appropriate that we discontinue the dollar for dollar match for charitable contributions as well as cash donations recognizing employees' volunteer hours with non-profit organizations.  Matching Gift or VIP submissions received prior to November 20 will be honored. We regret that we have had to make these changes.  We must continue to look for ways to reduce operating expenses through this transition period.    subject: Program Changes "
bryant@cheatsheets.net,0,0,0.941,ff950076-8c87-4aaa-9147-faee1d623258,"body: Quick note for you Pittman owners I may have worried with my comment about Thomas Jones scoring the Goalline TD. I'd forgotten my buddy Jim from Arizona had told me this:   Michael Pittman wears contact lenses and had a problem with one of his contacts at the goalline so Jones came in.   If Pittman had not had the problem, he would have likely gotten the score that Jones did.  (Hope none of you Pittman owners lost by a TD last week...) Thanks Jim for keeping me straight. Actually, I'm using that goof as a chance for David and I, along with the Footballguys.com staff, to wish you a very Happy Thanksgiving.   It's a always a time for reflecting on the things we're thankful for and I know I've got more than I can count.   Hope you do too.   Have a great day and travel safely if you're going anywhere. And not to beat up on our Detroit faithful (and I know there are LOT of you guys), but thought I'd share this one with you if you haven't heard it. David sent to me this morning: There is a mama lion, a daddy lion & a baby lion.  The mama lion & the daddy lion were having a lot of fights so they decided to get a divorce. The lion family goes in front of a judge to decide custody of the baby lion. The judge asks the baby lion ""Do you wanna live with mama lion?""   The baby lion answers ""No mama lion beats me.""  The judge said ""All right, do you wanna live with daddy lion?""  The baby lion answers ""No daddy lion beats me worse."" The judge asks ""who do you wanna live with then?"" The baby answers  ""The Detroit Lions.  They don't beat anybody..."" Have a great weekend all.   Cheatsheets to follow soon.

However, weak market fundamentals, including a sluggish economy and increased  US and Canadian supplies, will mitigate the usual winter price rise. CERA  expects an average Henry Hub price of $2.35 in November. *  Although inventories are close to record levels, storage pressures are  increasingly unlikely to drive cash markets down significantly this year.  *  Gas demand will average 14 percent lower than a year earlier; residential  and commercial sectors show a decline with a return to normal weather, while a  weak economy offsets the return of ammonia and dual-fuel loads in the  industrial sector. *  Regional storage inventories and weak regional demand should keep upward  pressure off of regional differentials.

bryant@cheatsheets.net,0,0,0.939,f2bf8be3-49fc-4c88-99ac-4dd841df70dc,"body: Entire story: http://www.boston.com/dailyglobe2/324/sports/Is_Brady_the_1_+.shtml Clipped from the Michael Smith article:   FOXBOROUGH - Bill Belichick said yesterday morning that Tom Brady will start at quarterback Sunday against New Orleans, then took it a step further in the afternoon, saying Brady will start Patriots games unless something drastic occurs. ''I think as we move forward here, unless something unforeseen happens that Tom will be the quarterback, and he'll get the snaps in practice and in the games,'' Belichick said on the ''Patriots Monday'' show on WWZN 1510. Yesterday morning Belichick told the media at Foxboro Stadium, ''I don't see any changes this week. I don't think this is the time to get into a big personnel evaluation, but I don't see any changes.'' Those comments came less than 12 hours afte his team's 24-17 loos to the St. Louis Rams. At the news conference, Belichick was brief with his responses regarding the quarterback situation, but his comments to Sean McDonough on his weekly radio show on WWZN gave the indication that Brady will be his starter for the forseeable future. That decision likely would not sit well with Drew Bledsoe, a nine-year veteran and three-time Pro Bowler. Bledsoe sustained a sheared blood vessel after a fierce hit by New York Jets linebacker Mo Lewis in Week 2, which opened the way for Brady to start the next eight games. Brady has led the Patriots to a 5-3 mark. ''Drew hasn't been able to play the last eight weeks ... and Tom's more game-ready at this point,'' Belichick said on the radio. ''That's the way we're going to go.'' Belichick reportedly informed the players of his plans last night during the weekly quarterbacks meeting. Patriots spokesman Stacey James confirmed only that the meeting had taken place. Normally, it is held on Tuesday night, but this week's schedule gives the players a day off for Thanksgiving, so it was moved up. Attempts to reach Belichick, Brady, and Bledsoe last night were unsuccessful. Before this season, Bledsoe signed the largest contract in NFL history, worth $103 million over 10 years. His compensation for this year alone is $11.5 million. Bledsoe was activated for the Rams game - for the first time since his injury - but watched as Brady threw two costly interceptions before bringing the Patriots within a touchdown with a 10-yard scoring pass to David Patten with 7:46 left. The first interception was a strike to Kevin Faulk early in the first quarter that bounced off the running back's shoulder pads. Dexter McCleon was there to make the pick, and the Rams scored the game's first touchdown three plays later. [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [  OUR VIEW  ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] You Brady owners can rest a little easier as it looks like he could be the man.   Nothing with Bill Belichick is ever set in stone so I wouldn't get too comfortable but obviously, this is good news for you Brady folks or those looking to snag him for the homestretch run.

THANKSGIVING FOOTBALL Remember that two NFL games will be played on Thursday:  Packers vs. Lions at 12:30 PM ET and Broncos vs. Cowboys at  4:05 PM ET. Fantasy 2001 players, if you have players from  these four teams on your roster, they must have their final  status (active or reserve) set 5 minutes before the start of  their game. Please keep in mind that you also will not be  able to enter any new add/drops for the week starting one  hour prior to Thursday's first kickoff. Football  Commissioner players, check with your league's commissioner  to see how your lineup deadline is handled this week.

Marcus Howell: Who would you start in Week 11: Brian Griese  at Dallas or Jake Plummer at San Diego? G.G. - Griese's receiving corps has been crippled by injuries  this season, and with Rod Smith questionable with an ankle  injury, the outlook gets dimmer. The Denver QB has been  bothered by physical problems this year as well. Plummer  seems like a better choice after a superb Week 10 outing. But  remember that he was facing the 0-9 Lions, and Plummer has  never been able to string many good performances together in  the past. He will be facing a San Diego defense that will be  primed for a good performance after getting burned badly by  Oakland last week. Go with Griese, who should at least post  respectable numbers at Dallas. Eric Fernau: Which three running backs should I start?  I  have Corey Dillon, Ricky Williams, Duce Staley, Priest  Holmes and Garrison Hearst. G.G. - Dillon is a must-start player every week. Holmes is  facing a Seattle defense that looks good statistically, but  will have a lot of trouble containing him on the outside.  Staley should have little trouble ripping through the  Washington front wall. It's hard to ignore Hearst at  Indianapolis or Williams in any week, but we like Dillon,  Holmes and Staley, especially the latter in an NFC East game. Jay Rassat: Who do I start this week at quarterback? I have  Tom Brady, Aaron Brooks and Trent Green. The defenses they  play against are all decent (N.O., N.E. and Seattle). G.G. - Brady and Brooks square off against each other, and  each is facing a secondary that can give up the big play.  Green will be facing a Seattle team that won't offer much of  a pass rush, but he is less explosive than Brooks or Brady.  With Brady having the advantage of playing at home, and Drew  Bledsoe looking over his shoulder, we'll go with the New  England QB. FANTASY FOOTBALL GUIDES Want to win your Fantasy League?

I would not be  surprised to see Watters not play again this year. Ricky's a  great back, and I wish him well, but you cannot replace a  back like Alexander. SPORTING NEWS Attention Fantasy Fans!

The Denver QB has been  bothered by physical problems this year as well. Plummer  seems like a better choice after a superb Week 10 outing. But  remember that he was facing the 0-9 Lions, and Plummer has  never been able to string many good performances together in  the past.

Here at Enron, the mail center and Business Controls/Corporate Security have already implemented safeguards so that all mail entering the Enron buildings will be screened in accordance with procedures for identifying suspicious packages.  We are also in touch with the U.S. Postal Service and the Centers for Disease Control to ensure we have the most complete and up-to-date guidance for handling any possible Anthrax exposures. However, should you receive an envelope or package that you do not feel comfortable opening, please contact Corporate Security at extension 3-6200 and we will screen it again. To provide Enron employees with a better understanding of  Anthrax and the potential danger it poses, we have posted a bulletin on the Corporate Security intranet site http://home.enron.com:84/security/002_bull_001.html that includes links to the CDC and USPS resources. subject: Questionable Mail/Suspicious Packages "

info@clubhyperia.com,0,0,0.944,47995405-16a5-4fd8-a064-ad368e0882d8,"body: NOVEMBER 23rd DJ ICEY and KIMBALL COLLINS flyer  located here: http://clubhyperia.com/weekly/iceykimball.htm DJ Icey Lurking in the shadows of Florida's burgeoning dame music community is a low-key musical visionary named DJ lcey. By day he runs his Zone Records indie, when the sun sets he regularly decimates dancefloors at clubs and raves all across America courtesy, of his crafty mixing manner. For the past seven years, DJ Icey has carefully avoided the, scrutiny and excesses of the spotlight, and has focused his energies on pioneering funky breaks, an energetic hybrid which incorporates booming hip-hop beats with an uptempo house sensibility and lots of bass in-your-face. ""I'm basically a shy person,"" says Icey, ""and I prefer to express myself through my music or when I'm DJING for a packed dancefloor,""  While growing up in Florida, DJ Icey was always infatuated with music of all types. He passionately collected vinyl and loved anything with a synth hook and electro drum beat. Having few musical limitations, he fell in love with a disparate melange of groups: Scritti Polliti, Run-DMC, New Order, Cabaret Voltaire and Audio Two. Anything with just the right groove sooner or later found its way into his collection, and his tastes soon broadened to run the gamut of club music: hip-hop, acid house, Chicago house, Miami Bass and Latin freestyle.  After getting his spinning career into full gear in Orlando, Icey went on to helm a legendary residency at the now defunct club, The Edge. Not only did he use that time to pioneer funky breaks and get his remix-production career going, he also made history by convincing the then unknown Chemical Brothers to play their first U.S. show on July 4, 1993 at The Edge. Upon the club's demise, Icey, hit the road xvit his crate of vinyl and hasn't looked back. Now regarded as the kind of funky breaks, he's won a legion of followers all across the country. And because of the eclectic nature of his sets, it's no wonder that on any given moment his dancefloor might be packed with break dancers, B-boys and househeads all losing their minds in unison.  That leads us to DJ Icey 14-track FFRR compilation, The Funky Breaks, which shows exactly why this mixmaster is tops on everyone's list. Not only does it portray his adept mixing technique, but it also pleasantly illustrates his playlist. Icey's association with FFRR dates back to when A&R man Nell Harris played a Zone Records 12"" of DJ Icey,s ""Big Ditch"" for FFRR kingpin Pete Tong. The duo were so taken with the track that they promptly licensed and re-released it adding ""Galaxo"" on the flip, later incorporating him into the Sunshine State Of Mind compilation, a well-received showcase of Florida's top dance producers.  The unpredictability of The Funky Breaks is clearly evident with DJ Icey throwing everything from his own ""Grand Canyon Suite"" and""Beats-a Rockin""' to PM Dawn's ""A Watcher's Point Of View"" and Armand Van Helden's remix of Genaside Its' ""Narra Mine."" ""I like to play with a lot of energy, and what you hear on The Funky Breaks is a good taste of -what I'm like when I spin,"" says Icey, who has also remixed the likes of Deee-Lite, Faith No More, Two Bad Mice, and A-Town Players. ""There's a lot of obscure tracks, such as the Ride Conunittee featuring Roxy's 'Get Huh' which has been a favorite of mine for a long time. I guess that I don't like to play a predictable set and this mix represents that.""  DJ lcey: he's always as funky as he wants to be.  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Kimball Collins is a renown Trance and House music DJ who has received global recognition for his unique style of DJ-ing and producing.  Kimball, who was raised in Orlando, Florida, started his DJ career in 1987 and since he has become one of the most respected and sought after House and Trance music DJ?s in the US.  After being the resident DJ for over five years at the now legendary Beacham Theater, which rose to prominence between 1989 and 1994, Kimball became the leading figure and probably the most talked about person in the Florida dance music scene. Kimball was a true originator of the house music movement in the southern region of America !  _______________________________________________________________________ Powered by List Builder To unsubscribe follow the link: http://lb.bcentral.com/ex/manage/subscriberprefs?customerid=6913&subid=E7805E677BA7F4E1&msgnum=78 subject: DJ ICEY and KIMBALL COLLINS THIS FRIDAY!

The National Transportation Safety Board investigation is still underway, with both the cockpit voice and flight data recorders being analyzed for clues about the cause of the accident. In addition to our normal aircraft inspection program, and as purely a precautionary measure, we have begun a voluntary inspection of all tail fins on the Airbus A300 fleet.  The inspection process started on Thursday and should be concluded next week. We have completed approximately 25% of the inspections. While we don't anticipate any problems, we certainly want to look at any and all possibilities for the accident's cause.  When the inspection is finished we will communicate those results. On behalf of all of us at American Airlines, I want to thank everyone for the outpouring of support we've received following Monday's tragedy. We are heartened by the many notes of care and concern. The unprecedented actions over the past 60 days have tested the entire nation in a way that could not be envisioned prior to September 11.  I hope that you find these communications informative. It is my pledge to you to keep you informed of not only issues surrounding the accident but also security and airport process measures that we are implementing across our system. On behalf of the 100,000 employees at American, TWA and American Eagle, thanks for your support. Sincerely,  Mike Gunn Executive Vice President American Airlines * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * Subscribe / Unsubscribe Instructions This email has been sent to MCUILLA@ENRON.COM This special edition is being sent to those who currently  receive AADVANTAGE E-SUMMARY or AAIRMAIL.

bryant@cheatsheets.net,0,0,0.934,9cdde78f-53be-430c-81e0-0aeaaae33a6f,"body: Entire story: http://cbs.sportsline.com/u/wire/stories/0,1169,4534966_59,00.html IRVING, Texas (AP) Emmitt Smith will return to the Dallas Cowboys' lineup Sunday against Philadelphia after missing two games with a sprained right knee. Coach Dave Campo said after practice Friday that Smith would ""be ready to play the majority of the game."" Smith returned to practice Thursday and was back on the field Friday. He was hurt during the Cowboys' 17-3 win over Arizona on Oct. 28 when he was tackled after a 1-yard gain in the final two minutes. Smith, the NFL's second-leading career rusher, did not speak with reporters. Before missing consecutive games for the first time in his 12-year NFL career, Smith had missed only two other games because of injury - one in 1994 and another five years later. Smith has 15,564 career yards rushing, 1,162 behind Walter Payton's NFL record. Troy Hambrick, who rushed for 204 yards while replacing Smith in losses to the New York Giants and Atlanta, will start at fullback. [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [  OUR VIEW  ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] Doesn't make a lot of sense to me with Hambrick playing the way he does but far be it from me to try and figure out Jerry Jones.   Emmitt has paid the dues and has earned the start I suppose when he's healthy.   Bottom line is put a heavy downgrade on Hambrick for now.

It was reported in several places, including CBS Sportsline. Now CBS Sportsline is offering this http://football0.commissioner.com/mp/pro-home?league=zero  :   ""Contrary to some earlier reports, Anderson will remain the starter in Denver's backfield for now. Some reports had indicated that Olandis Gary would start in his place."" This seems to be consistent with what the local Denver press is saying as well. Clearly, nothing is for certain with a Mike Shanahan Running Back Corps but for now, it looks like Anderson is back as the starter although I wouldn't be surprised to see Gary see some carries as well.

[ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [  OUR VIEW  ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] Welcome to Shannyland... Terrell Davis caught 5 passes last week and this could be an area where Mike Shanahan wants to use Gary.   It's logical that both could see time until Terrell Davis is ready.   Or I wouldn't be surprised to see Anderson get all the carries.   Sadly, I wouldn't be surprised to see Gary get all the carries.   It's a murky deal there right now.   Unless it clears up pretty fast, I'd probably avoid. Joe /**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/ Bryant Analytics, Inc.

bryant@cheatsheets.net,0,0,0.933,3d03a9b7-a2f0-4eba-b604-3e2024deeca7,"body: Entire story:   http://espn.go.com/nfl/news/2001/1115/1278717.html Knee Injury Sidelines James for Rest of Season The second opinion sought by Edgerrin James on his damaged left knee, and obtained in the last few days, has confirmed the worst -- the Indianapolis Colts star tailback is out for the remainder of the season. ESPN.com has learned through various league sources, including several close to the two-time league rushing champion, that James has been apprised he will require surgery to repair a torn anterior cruciate ligament. That determination was made by noted South Florida orthopedic surgeon John Uribe, the second specialist to examine James' knee. James, who was injured in an Oct. 28 game at Kansas City, has missed Indianapolis' last two games. ESPN's Chris Mortensen first reported Monday that James was likely out for the year. The team's first-round pick in the 1999 draft, James, 23, had played in 38 consecutive games until the injury. While club officials continue to concede only that James will miss the next 2-3 weeks and suggested reports he is lost for the rest of the season are premature, the tailback has told several teammates his 2001 campaign is over. Although the timing could change, James tentatively plans to confirm the injury and announce details of the surgery and for his subsequent rehabilitation at a press conference next Tuesday. A date for the surgery, which will be performed by Dr. Uribe, has not yet been set. But the rehabilitation period is expected to be 6-8 months and could mean that James will not be totally rehabilitated in time for the start of training camp next summer. James is familiar with Uribe, the team doctor at the University of Miami, where the Colts tailback played collegiately, and apparently has great faith in his judgment. The fourth overall player selected in the '99 draft, James led the league in rushing as a rookie (1,553 yards) and then again for the 2000 season (1,709 yards). His total of 3,262 yards is the second-most ever by a player in the first two seasons of his career. [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [  OUR VIEW  ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] Confirms what we reported to you earlier from ESPN's Chris Mortensen. Here's what Bill Polian said after it was first reported James was done for the season three days ago:  ""So I turned my computer on. I read the report on ESPN and I just kind of chuckled. I don't know where they get this information.   ""It (the report) is a lot of uninformed speculation from people who are uninformed,"" Evidently, we weren't as uninformed as he thought... What this means for you is that Dominic Rhodes has a chance to shine.   He's got a nicked shoulder but is reportedly set to play this weekend and will be looking to make the most of his opportunity.   Keep a close eye on this one. Thanks to Footballguy Joe Profaizer for pointing me to this one. Joe /**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/ Bryant Analytics, Inc.

Laughing) Joe /**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/ Vikings' Bennett Will Miss Game, Moss' Play Will Be Limited Entire Story:  http://www.startribune.com/stories/503/760564.html Clipped from the Kevin Seifert article published online 10-16-01: An offense based on speed might have to get by on guile this week. The Vikings' two fastest players are questionable for Sunday's game against the Green Bay Packers, and one of them almost certainly will not play. Receiver Randy Moss and tailback Michael Bennett are both suffering from sprained right ankles, and while Moss likely will play at limited capacity, Bennett is expected sit out Sunday. The revelation of Moss' injury coincided with his least productive start in four NFL seasons, while Bennett's ailment will allow him to quietly step back from his own disappointing start and give way to Doug Chapman. ""I think Randy will be able to play,"" Vikings coach Dennis Green said Monday. ""I don't think there is any doubt about that. Michael will probably not be able to play."" Moss seemed less confident of that certainty, however. The ankle, which he originally sprained playing basketball prior to minicamp in 1998, began throbbing during Sunday's 31-26 victory over the Detroit Lions. Green and members of the Vikings' medical staff characterized the pain as residual affects from the 1998 injury, a condition he will continue to have the rest of his career. But Moss woke up Monday morning with more stiffness and soreness than ever, according to trainer Chuck Barta. As he departed Winter Park, Moss said the ankle ""is fine, man. It's fine."" But asked if there was no doubt he would play Sunday, Moss only shrugged his shoulders. It would behoove him to try; Moss has caught passes for at least 100 yards in five of his six games against the Packers, and has more receiving yards against them (753) than any other team. Bennett, who cut off interviews with local media last week, declined to comment Monday. The No. 1 draft choice has struggled to replace Robert Smith as the Vikings' featured running back, rushing for 214 yards and a 3.5 yards-per-carry average while failing to score a touchdown in five games. The Vikings also have been disappointed in his ability to pick up blitzes in pass protection. While Chapman does not represent a clear improvement in that area, some in the organization believe Bennett might benefit from a week or two on the sideline. He was limping noticeably Monday at Winter Park while wearing an immobilizing boot. Assuming the Vikings rule Bennett out for Sunday, Green said Chapman would start and Travis Prentice would begin assuming more of a short-yardage role. Harold Morrow would serve as a third tailback. Chapman, who has rushed 11 times for 38 yards in limited playing time this season, said he would be ready. ""It's not music to my ears when somebody gets injured, but this is the NFL,"" Chapman said. ""I'm more than capable. I'm just going to go out and do what I have to do."" Of greater concern, is Moss' condition. He has caught 21 passes for 321 yards and one touchdown in five games this season; his second-lowest output for the first five games of a season came in 1999, when he caught 21 passes for 365 yards and three touchdowns. Moss had an uncharacteristically sloppy game Sunday against the Lions, dropping two passes and allowing a third to go through his arms and into the hands of Lions cornerback Todd Lyght for an interception. He mistimed his jump on several other occasions, a mistake Green attributed to the injury, and Moss removed himself from the game liberally to catch his breath. ""Randy Moss doesn't normally drop passes,"" Green said. ""One thing you can always tell, if a guy is hurt, his concentration level is not there. It's very difficult to play at your best if you are not 100 percent health-wise. I think that was clearly the case yesterday with Randy, so we're going to do everything we can to get him as close to possible to 100 percent."" Moss has never missed a game since joining the Vikings, playing in all 53 regular season and six postseason games. He declined an invitation to the 2001 Pro Bowl after bruising several ribs during the NFC Championship Game, but Green lauded Moss' tolerance for pain. Moss will undergo round-the-clock rehabilitation this week, and Green said he should know by Thursday how much Moss will be able to play. Without Moss at his best and without Bennett at all, the Vikings will be missing two of their top speedsters against the Packers. Their injuries will place an even greater emphasis on the performance of quarterback Daunte Culpepper, who rushed for a career-high 83 yards Sunday while also playing a near error-free game. ""We prefer to have our total speed out there, but we're a fast team overall,"" Green said. ""We're quick and explosive. It's not just because we have Randy, because we have some other guys with some speed. So we will be able to operate. I think the best thing is that Daunte will get better every game. He loves big games. I think he'll be ready to play a tremendous game and we'll depend on him to a certain extent to help operate our offense this week."" [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [  OUR VIEW  ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] Clearly, bad news here.   You know we never got on the Bennett bandwagon but he's been even worse than we expected.   Chapman could make some noise but the Travis Prentice issue is ugly.   Plus you have the best goalline ""back"" in the game with QB Daunte Culpepper.   For Moss, my guess based on what we know now is that you have to start him and cross your fingers.   He's too good to sit unless you have excellent options at WR.   He can turn a game (and your weekend) around in a couple of plays.   I'd have to be blind to say I wasn't seriously worried about him but I don't think I could sit him unless you're really deep there. More as we hear it.

no.address@enron.com,0,0,0.889,28fd5384-80c1-4efa-88ba-1c1c3d4e24ba,"body: Today, we announced our third quarter earnings results, which were right on target with analysts estimates for recurring earnings per diluted share of $0.43.  This marks a 26 percent increase over the third quarter of last year, which is due to the strong performance of our core wholesale and retail energy businesses and our natural gas pipelines.  In addition, we also announced that we are on track for our earnings target of $0.45 for the fourth quarter ($1.80 for 2001) and $2.15 for 2002. We made a commitment to you that we would provide you with timely information about Enron's business strategy and performance, so this email is intended to provide an explanation about our earnings this quarter. Over the past few months, we have met with analysts to discuss Enron's performance.  We received considerable feedback from investors and analysts that we needed to expand our financial reporting to include details for more of our business units.  In response to that feedback, we have provided results separately for several of our business units.  For example, while we have provided volume figures for North America and Europe, this is the first quarter we have provided financials separately for Enron Americas and for Europe and Other Commodities.  In addition, information about our global assets had previously been included in our numbers for Wholesale Services.  This quarter they are reported separately.   Finally, even though our broadband business is now part of Enron Wholesale Services, we are continuing to report that business separately. Following are the highlights of our businesses: Wholesale Services: Total income before interest, minority interests and taxes (IBIT) increased 28% to $754 million in the third quarter.  Total wholesale physical volumes increased 65% to 88.2 trillion British thermal units equivalent per day (Tbtue/d). Americas: IBIT increased 31% to $701 million.  Natural gas volumes increased 6% to 26.7 Tbtu/d, and power volumes increased 77% to 290 million megawatt hours (MWh). Europe and Other Commodity Markets: IBIT remained unchanged at $53 million as compared to last year.  While physical gas and power volumes increased, low volatility in these markets caused profitability to remain flat. Retail Services: Enron Energy Services reported IBIT of $71 million, compared to $27 million a year ago.  So far this year, EES has completed more than 50 transactions with large customers and more than 95,000 deals with small business customers. Transportation and Distribution: 	Natural Gas Pipelines: IBIT increased slightly to $85 million in the third quarter. Portland General: We reported an IBIT loss of $(17) million this quarter compared to IBIT of $74 million a year ago.  This loss is due to power contracts PGE entered into at prices that were significantly higher than actual settled prices during the third quarter.  Last week, we  announced an agreement to sell PGE to Northwest Natural.  This transaction is expected to close next year. Global Assets: This segment includes Elektro, Dabhol, TGS, Azurix and Enron Wind.  Third quarter IBIT remained unchanged at $19 million compared to last year. Broadband Services: IBIT losses were $(80) million in the current quarter compared to a $(20) million loss last year.  This quarter's results include significantly lower investment-related income and lower operating costs. Corporate and other: This segment includes the unallocated expenses associated with general corporate functions. This segment reported an IBIT loss of $(59) million compared to $(106) million a year ago. In addition, this quarter we announced one-time charges of $1.01 billion.  Over the past few quarters, we have conducted a thorough  review of our businesses and have decided to take certain charges to clear away issues that have clouded the performance and earnings potential  of our core businesses.  These charges include: ?	A $287 million write-down of Azurix Corp. ?	$183 million associated with the restructuring of Broadband Services.  This includes severance costs, a loss on the sale of inventory like servers and routers, and a write-down of the value of our content services contracts due to the bankruptcy of a number of customers. ?	$544 million related to losses from certain investments, primarily Enron's interest in The New Power Company, broadband and technology investments and early termination of a structured finance arrangement.   With our announcements this quarter we accomplished three things:  1) we showed continued strong earnings and earnings growth in our core businesses, 2) we cleared away those things that were clouding this superb performance in our core businesses, and 3) We expanded our reporting of financial results to increase transparency for our investors.

bryant@cheatsheets.net,0,0,0.946,61139e83-d064-4084-9ced-3c4e4262901c,"body: Entire story:   http://espn.go.com/nfl/news/2001/1123/1283244.html Rookie Anthony Thomas, who has emerged as the Chicago Bears' top running back this season, may miss Sunday's NFC Central clash against the Minnesota Vikings. Thomas, who has 638 rushing yards and four touchdowns, has been downgraded to doubtful for Sunday's game with a strained right hamstring. James Allen, a 1,000-yard rusher last season who lost his job to Thomas, likely would start if Thomas is inactive for Sunday's game. This is a crucial game for both teams. The Bears (7-2) need the victory to stay ahead of the Packers in the Central, and the Vikings (4-5) need the win simply to stay in the hunt for a playoff spot. [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [  OUR VIEW  ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] It's a dice roll here, folks.   He hasn't practiced all week and James Allen has been working with the first team.   If you don't have anyone close to Thomas' ability, you might roll the dice with him but if you've got another option, I'd probably go with the safer route.   From Coach Dick Jauron's eyes, I'm guessing he sees Allen as not a horrible choice plus the fact he wants to get Allen healthy for the stretch run and playoffs.   Just my guess though.

Thanks Bob and Happy Thanksgiving Everyone. Joe /**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/ THOMAS SKIPS PRACTICE TO REST SORE HAMSTRING... Posted Thursday November 22, 2001 @ 03:35 PT According to chicagobears.com senior writer Larry Mayer, Anthony Thomas sat out practice Wednesday with a strained right hamstring, but the Bears are hopeful the rookie running back will start Sunday night's game against the Minnesota Vikings at the Metrodome. ""We're concerned with him,"" head coach Dick Jauron admitted. ""He said he felt better today than he felt yesterday. We'll monitor him right through the week, but I don't think we're going to know anything really until close to the end of the week."" Jauron revealed that Thomas has been hampered by the nagging injury for a few weeks. That would appear to explain the A-Train's recent decline in production. The second-round pick rushed for 58 yards on 23 carries in last Sunday's win at Tampa and 45 yards on 22 attempts a week earlier in a loss to Green Bay. In his three previous outings, Thomas averaged 137 yards on 27 carries including a 188-yard performance in Cincinnati. That effort shattered a 67-year-old team rookie record held by Beattie Feathers, who rushed for 155 yards against Green Bay in 1934. Thomas was named the NFL Rookie of the Month in October, but he hasn't displayed the same explosive burst since. He had seven runs of at least 16 yards (46, 32, 23, 21, 19, 18, 16) in the first six games, but none longer than 12 yards the last three weeks. ""He's not a guy who complains, but it's had to bother him and he's missed practice time, which is not good either,"" Jauron said. ""When you have a hamstring problem, you're going to feel it any time you try to accelerate at all. ""He felt OK today in terms of where he was a week ago, but not good enough to practice. We'll just have to see where that one goes."" Thomas said Wednesday that he's confident he'll play against the Vikings and felt the hamstring problem was related to a sore left big toe that's bothered him most of the season. The toe is much improved, but he believes it contributed to the hamstring injury. ""Once you favor one thing and compensate for something else, there's always going to be something that's off-balance,"" Thomas said. ""I guess that's probably one of the things that did it. ""My toe is coming around a lot better now. It's probably the best it ever felt. Just from compensating, my leg's a little sore on the other side. But my foot's doing real well."" Thomas said he planned to test the hamstring Thursday in practice. If he were unable to play Sunday, James Allen would replace him. Thomas supplanted Allen as the starter after the rookie's 188-yard outburst Oct. 21 in Cincinnati. The performance was the eighth best in team history and the most prolific rushing day since the legendary Walter Payton had 192 yards on 28 carries on Nov. 3, 1985 at Green Bay. Thomas ranks fifth in the NFC with 638 yards and 4 TDs on 150 carries (4.3 avg.), while Allen has rushed for 243 yards and 1 TD on 78 attempts (3.1). Since losing the starting job, Allen has carried just five times in four games for 36 yards. Despite the limited action, the four-year veteran did contribute one of the biggest plays of the season. He dove to catch a 34-yard Hail Mary TD pass from Shane Matthews on the final play of regulation in an eventual overtime win over Cleveland Nov. 4 at Soldier Field. If Thomas is limited Sunday, Allen would relish the chance for more playing time in what's the Bears' third of six straight divisional games. Last season the Oklahoma product rushed for a career-high 1,120 yards and his 290 carries were the second most by a Bear since Payton retired. ""I'm ready,"" Allen said. ""We have a lot riding on this game, just like we do week-in and week-out. I just have to play my part, see how it goes, and stay into it mentally. ""Just to help this team win, if it's 10 carries or 25 carries, I've got to do my part."" Stay tuned. ... I'll have more on Thomas after today's practice. /**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/ Bryant Analytics, Inc.

bryant@cheatsheets.net,0,0,0.942,a28407ed-6996-478c-b287-2d80043c474f,"body: Entire story: http://chicagosports.com/bears/content/story/0,1984,168218,00.html Clipped from the John Mullin article: The Bears are preparing to play one of the NFL's poorest defenses against the run but may face that defense without their No. 1 running back. Rookie tailback Anthony Thomas is questionable with a strained hamstring that has bothered him for the last couple of weeks, got a little worse in the win over Tampa Bay and could eventually cause coaches to hold him out of a game to let it heal. Thomas did not practice Wednesday and his status for Sunday night's game at Minnesota will not be determined until closer to game time. ""I can't say when I really did it,"" Thomas said. ""It just bothered me a little more at the end and halftime when you rest on it awhile."" Injuries are part of every week's preparations and players become accustomed to playing with pain and injury. But with a playoff berth possible, the Bears may bench Thomas to let the hamstring get closer to full strength. ""We could get there,"" said coach Dick Jauron. ""You definitely don't want to do that, but any player that's out there that has an injury that causes them to not only be not as effective as they can be but also risks further injury, you don't want to expose him to that. We'll just have to monitor that really closely."" [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [  OUR VIEW  ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] Just passing along.   Realize the Bears are thinking now much further past just this game.   Dick Jauron knows Anthony Thomas will be a big part of their playoff success and he may be thinking conservatively here.

bryant@cheatsheets.net,0,0,0.94,af6a2352-b215-4305-800a-06d55d56719e,"body: Hi Folks, Trying to get this to you earlier as many people had asked for it sooner. Hope you have a great and joyful Thanksgiving. Here's how I see the Passing Game Matchups this week. PLEASE NOTE:   See the cheatsheets online at www.footballguys.com  for exactly where I rank players and to determine who to start.   I always receive emails asking me how I can have a guy ranked highly on the cheatsheet but listed under a matchup that favors the Defense.   Just because one matchup may be more favorable than another, that doesn't necessarily mean I'd start the player with the best matchup.   Peyton Manning may have a horrible matchup one week but unless you're sitting on Kurt Warner or Daunte Culpepper, Manning's your guy no matter who he's lining up against.   The matchup info is meant to be just one more tool in your box when it comes to deciding between players. Note:  I've used the player stats sorted by performance over the last four weeks extensively in developing these write-ups. Stats are provided by Mike Hall's excellent FLM League Management Software.  http://www.fflm.com/ for more info.   The points scored by position data is from our Footballguy Clayton Gray.  Let's get to it. Joe /**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/ Passing Game Matchups to Avoid and Exploit Locks:  These games feature Defenses that should be overmatched against the Offense. Arizona Passing Game vs San Diego Defense We rated Plummer as a ""Lock"" matchup and he delivered with 334 yards and 4 TDs.   If only they could play Detroit each week...  This week, they'll face a San Diego team that ranks just # 26 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks and # 23 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs.   WR David Boston is unstoppable and a must start.   Frank Sanders played well too last week but had what looked to be a pretty serious hamstring injury on the TD reception.   Check Plummer's status as he has a bruised tailbone but I'd feel good about him again this week. Atlanta Passing Game vs Carolina Defense Chris Chandler continued his up and down season with a nice outing last week leading the Falcons to a huge upset over the Packers.   He threw for 352 yards and 2 TDs.   Terance Mathis led the way with 7 receptions.   Mathis suffered a concussion but the early reports are that he'll be able to go. This week, the Falcons face a soft Carolina defense that ranks # 21 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 30 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 23 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs so this is looking pretty enticing. Chicago Passing Game vs Minnesota Defense Jim Miller to Marty Booker looked more like Montana to Rice Sunday.   I don't recall the last time I saw two consecutive bomb TDs to the same player like that Sunday.   Miller's been up and down but clearly, Booker is a guy to watch.   Dez White and David Terrell are in the mix but this seems to be Booker's show.   The Viking defense ranks # 29 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks so it looks like the Bears may be able to continue to roll. Green Bay Passing Game vs Detroit Defense Favre isn't as red hot as he was but he's still a premier QB.   He threw for 262 yards and 2 TDs last week.   He spread the ball pretty well between Billy Schroeder, Antonio Freeman and Corey Bradford.   Bradford had the big yardage while Schroeder and Freeman scored.   All 3 are solid plays.   TE Bubba Franks continues to be a non factor.   The Pack draw a great matchup this week in Detroit that ranks # 27 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   They rank # 31 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs so you have to like that. Minnesota Passing Game vs Chicago Defense If you'd been thinking about benching Daunte Culpepper, Randy Moss, or Cris Carter, you got your answer Monday night.   These guys should always be in your lineup as they're too explosive to sit against any matchup.   The Bears rank # 31 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks so clearly, this is a must start for these guys.   The only downside to the Moss / Carter explosion was that TE Byron Chamberlain was left out of the party. San Francisco Passing Game vs Indianapolis Defense You don't need me to tell you to start Jeff Garcia.   He's clearly one of the premier QBs in the game.   Terrell Owens is freaky good and is obviously a must start.   J.J. Stokes had a breakout game last week so he deserves a look.   Tai Streets is not a bad reach and TE Eric Johnson is getting more involved in the offense each week.   It's sort of like St. Louis where any of these guys are worth a gamble.   Indy ranks # 23 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   They rank # 25 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 26 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs so the 49ers are looking good here. /**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/ Prime Matchups:  These games feature Defenses that should have trouble stopping the Offense. Baltimore Passing Game vs Jacksonville Defense Does anyone else find the Baltimore's self destruction amusing?   The Grbac tear thing on the sidelines (which looked like sweat to me) and then Shannon Sharpe's posturing as the self appointed spokesperson shouting about interceptions was pretty funny.   Can Brian Billick hold it all together? Where's Trent Dilfer when you need him?   Grbac will be fine I think. Sharpe is always a good play if you can stand having him on your team. Qadry Ismail and Travis Taylor are both decent options as they're seeing plenty of action and TE Todd Heap even got a score.   Lots of weapons in this passing game.   They'll be facing a Jaguar defense that's reeling and beat up.   They rank # 25 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   Jacksonville ranks # 18 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs for the year.   All in all, a good matchup here. Detroit Passing Game vs Green Bay Defense A perfect example of how sometimes the NFL does NOT mirror Fantasy. Charlie Batch is becoming a desirable QB simply because his team is so bad and he's forced to throw on every down.   Regardless of the reason, you have to give this guy some credit as he's clearly becoming more comfortable in the system.   He threw an amazing 62 attempts last week for 436 yards and 3 TDs.   I'll take that.   WR Johnnie Morton led the way with 153 yards.   RB Lamont Warren had 11 catches but his status is up in the air with the return of James Stewart.   Green Bay is nothing special against the pass lately ranking # 22 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks. For the year, they are pretty tough on QBs though ranking # 8 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 3 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs. Kansas City Passing Game vs Seattle Defense Trent Green had a week off to get everything together but you have to wonder how much can be done in a week.   Derrick Alexander is supposedly ready to play this week but you know how that goes.   I'd be leery until I see him play some.   Snoop Minnis is still nursing an ankle injury and is iffy.   As always, TE Tony Gonzalez is the primary threat.   Seattle has been below average lately ranking # 20 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 29 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 25 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs. New England Passing Game vs New Orleans Defense Coach Bill Belichick raised some eyebrows when he announced Tom Brady would be the starter until further notice.   Great news for Brady fans who'd been sweating a Bledsoe comeback.   Brady's come back down to earth lately with a mediocre 185 yard day last week but he's still showing promise.   WR Troy Brown is by far the favored target and the only real receiver worthy of a start in most leagues.   New Orleans has been very vulnerable lately to the pass ranking # 30 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 16 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs. New Orleans Passing Game vs New England Defense Aaron Brooks once again offers some vindication for those (including us) who'd been sweating it after giving him lots of preseason hype.   2 passing TDs plus another TD rushing Sunday made his owners happy.   I'd go with the hot hand and keep him in your lineup.   Joe Horn is clearly the WR of choice as Willie Jackson is up and down.   TE Boo Williams is not a bad reach if you need a guy there.   He caught 2 TDs and looked good doing it.   New England ranks # 24 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks but be careful, as Bill Belichick seems to sometimes pull out something special to confuse young QBs. Oakland Passing Game vs New York Giants Defense You have to like Rich Gannon here against the Giant defense that was torched by Minnesota last week.   Gannon threw for 311 yards and 4 TDs Sunday and looks as in control of this offense as ever.   Jerry Rice looked half his age running all over the field and played outstanding.   Tim Brown is as good as ever.   This team has serious weapons and should go deep in the playoffs, if not all the way.   The Giants rank # 15 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks but for the year they rank # 3 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs. Pittsburgh Passing Game vs Tennessee Defense Kordell Stewart once again looked like a real NFL QB.   He threw for 266 yards and a TD.   Most importantly, he didn't fold up when Jerome Bettis was held down.   Hines Ward caught 9 passes for 112 yards and a TD and looks to be a good play most every week as he's clearly the go to guy.   Tennessee ranks just # 19 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks. They rank # 26 for the year in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs so these Steelers could have a chance to do something through the air here. San Diego Passing Game vs Arizona Defense Doug Flutie's magic trick bag seems to be fairly well empty lately.   Losing TE Freddie Jones last week surely didn't help even though Jones wasn't being thrown to as much as we'd like to see.   Curtis Conway and Jeff Graham struggled with Flutie.   This Arizona defense could be the ticket though as Charlie Batch discovered last week.   They rank # 17 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks but are playing softer than that. They rank # 27 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 24 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs. St. Louis Passing Game vs Tampa Bay Defense Kurt Warner's a must start, obviously.   As are Isaac Bruce and Torry Holt. Both are outstanding.   Bruce had the big yards Sunday while Holt got the TD.   RB Marshall Faulk catches as many passes as the WRs, just another reason why he's the best.   Tampa is limping but they rank # 9 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   They do have 13 sacks over the last 4 games so they're obviously putting pressure on the QB. /**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/ Even Matchups:  These games feature no real advantage either way Carolina Passing Game vs Atlanta Defense Are you really down to starting Chris Weinke?   I didn't think so.   Muhsin Muhammad could miss this week's game with a shoulder injury.   That means Donald Hayes would be the go to guy assuming his sore ribs allow him to go. TE Wesley Walls is always a threat although he seems to be less of the focus lately.   Maybe he needs to have another ""Keyshawn Fit"" and yell about not getting the ball enough.   That worked pretty well for him last time.   The Falcons rank # 12 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks but for the year, rank # 28 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs.   They rank # 30 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs so they're definitely toastable. Cincinnati Passing Game vs Cleveland Defense It doesn't appear to be the best thing for the Bengals, but Jon Kitna continues to air it out.   He threw 42 passes Sunday for 234 yards and 1 TD / 2 Interceptions.   The Bengals have about 25 WRs it seems and all are pretty good.   Ron Dugans got into the act scoring a TD Sunday.   Darnay Scott is the # 1 but it's a crowded group there making it tough to pick out any one player.   The Brown defense ranks # 28 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks so you'd think Cincinnati would be able to throw the ball.    For the year, Cleveland ranks # 5 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs though so it's not like it's a cakewalk. Cleveland Passing Game vs Cincinnati Defense Tim Couch is winning the ""real"" NFL games even though he's not doing much for your FF team lately.   His 144 yard / 0 TD / 3 Int game Sunday is an example of that.   He'll get back on track though.   Kevin Johnson and Dennis Northcutt seem to be his primary guys with Quincy Morgan there too. Honestly, I wouldn't count on too much from anyone but Johnson.   The Bengal defense ranks # 10 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks so they've been tough lately.   For the year, they rank # 22 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs. Indianapolis Passing Game vs San Francisco Defense Peyton Manning looked solid even with the broken jaw.   Jerome Pathon is gone for the year and Reggie Wayne's knee is an issue.   It looks like it'll be his old reliable target, Marvin Harrison.   Keep an eye on TE Marcus Pollard as he could easily be the best receiver after Harrison.   San Francisco ranks # 13 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks and # 19 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs.   You never know when Manning will throw that monster game though so it's tough not to play him if he's on your roster. Philadelphia Passing Game vs Washington Defense Donovan McNabb didn't wow anyone with his numbers Sunday but he didn't need to in order to win the game.   He threw for 129 yards with 1 TD.   James Thrash is still the go to guy with Todd Pinkston worth a roll of the dice in larger leagues.   TE Chad Lewis was pretty active and caught a TD so you like to see that.   The Redskins are starting to believe in themselves and now rank # 18 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks. A dangerous game against the Redskins who have nothing to lose and can play with abandon. /**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/ Downside Matchups:  These games feature a Defense that could pose trouble for the Offense. Buffalo Passing Game vs Miami Defense As a consistent Rob Johnson basher, Alex Van Pelt kept me from looking bad by playing extremely well Sunday with 2 TDs and 316 yards.   And he actually finished a game...   Clearly, he gives the Bills a boost.   Eric Moulds is still the #1 WR but Peerless Price had a huge game with 138 yards and a TD. Larry Centers was also extremely involved and TE Jay Riemersma caught a TD. Miami is hurting without CB Sam Madison.   They rank # 6 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks so they're still tough. Denver Passing Game vs Dallas Defense Brian Griese just keeps losing weapons.   From Ed McCaffrey to Terrell Davis, now Rod Smith is limited with a bad ankle.   There's only so much a QB can do without his weapons.   Smith is saying he'll try to tough it out and play Thursday but it's very questionable how effective he'll be if he plays.   My friend (and Denver local) B.J. Miller says his guess is that Smith will dress but likely not finish the game after re-aggravating the ankle.  I'd agree with that prediction.   TE Desmond Clark needs to become a bigger part of the passing game here.   The Cowboys are solid on defense ranking # 5 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks and # 10 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs so it's a tough matchup here for the Broncos. New York Giants Passing Game vs Oakland Defense Kerry Collins threw for 321 yards but couldn't find the endzone Monday night.   Ike Hilliard continues to improve and actually was more effective than Amani Toomer.  Tiki Barber remains a strong force in the passing game and that should continue.   All 3 of these guys are solid starters. Oakland is very solid lately against the pass ranking # 4 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 15 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 16 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs. Seattle Passing Game vs Kansas City Defense Matt Hasselbeck posted 134 yards and 1 TD Sunday.   With the way Shaun Alexander is running, that's probably enough.   Koren Robinson and Darrel Jackson are the primary targets but Hasselbeck is really spreading the ball around.   Kansas City ranks # 14 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks although for the year, they rank # 6 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs. Tampa Bay Passing Game vs St. Louis Defense Brad Johnson rolled up 399 yards Sunday without throwing a TD.   That's hard to do.   Keyshawn Johnson remains TD-less which I admit is cruelly amusing. That'll have to break soon though as he's just catching too many passes not to score.   I wouldn't be surprised to see him explode with a couple of multiple TD games as the odds even out.   Johnson to Johnson is really all there is to talk about with this passing game.   The Rams are solid ranking # 7 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 12 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs. Washington Passing Game vs Philadelphia Defense Tony Banks left with a concussion Sunday but Kent Graham did a fine job filling in.   WR Michael Westbrook has shown nice maturity this season hanging in there and now looks to be the quality WR everyone has always expected him to be.   He had 9 receptions for 104 yards and a TD last week. The Eagle defense can be troublesome with all their blitzing so it'll be a challenge.   Philadelphia ranks # 11 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks and for the year, they rank # 1 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs.   Should be a tough game. /**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/ Defensive Slam Dunks:  These games feature a very tough Defense posing major problems for the Offense. Dallas Passing Game vs Denver Defense Ryan Leaf did little to impress anyone Sunday with a 102  yard / 0 TD / 2 Interception game.   I can't get excited about anyone on this offense. Joey Galloway could be worth a shot just for his home run potential but it's pretty bleak overall.   Denver ranks # 8 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks and that doesn't help any. Jacksonville Passing Game vs Baltimore Defense Mark Brunell is looking very iffy again and it'll likely be Jonathon Quinn again.   (Has there ever been a good QB named Jonathon?)   That's bad news for the Jaguar WRs Jimmy Smith and Keenan McCardell although both played decent last week.   With Fred Taylor out again, Baltimore should have a field day.   The Ravens rank # 16 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks but for the year, rank # 7 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs. I'd shy away from these guys unless I had few options. Miami Passing Game vs Buffalo Defense Jay Fiedler looked lost last week throwing for 188 yards, 0 TDs and 3 Interceptions.   He'll have his up and down games but he seems to be settling back more toward the downside.   His WR corps is solid with James McKnight, Oronde Gadsden and Chris Chambers but it's hard to put a lot of faith in Fiedler.   I do like Chambers and his big play ability.   Buffalo has been tough lately ranking # 3 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   It's actually not so much an issue of them being tough as it is teams just don't need to throw to beat them.   Regardless, offenses haven't been putting up a lot of yards on them.   For the year, they rank # 24 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs. Tennessee Passing Game vs Pittsburgh Defense A typical Steve McNair week:   Major questions all week as to whether he'll be healthy enough to play.   Guts it out through the game, rushing for more yards than George, throwing for 172 yards and 1 TD.   It might win NFL games but that probably won't carry your FF team.   Derrick Mason and Kevin Dyson are both decent players at WR while TE Frank Wycheck remains his best receiver.   The Steelers bring a great defense though ranking # 2 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   They rank # 2 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs not to mention the fact they've logged 18 sacks over the last 4 games.   Tough matchup here. /**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/ Bryant Analytics, Inc.

Here's how I see the Rushing Game Matchups this week. PLEASE NOTE:   See the cheatsheet online www.footballguys.com for exactly where I rank players and to determine who to start.   I always receive emails asking me how I can have a guy ranked highly on the cheatsheet but listed under a matchup that favors the Defense.   Just because one matchup may be more favorable than another, that doesn't necessarily mean I'd start the player with the best matchup.   Ahman Green may have a horrible matchup one week but unless you're sitting on Ricky Williams or Marshall Faulk, Green's your guy no matter who he's lining up against.   The matchup info is meant to be just one more tool in your box when it comes to deciding between players. Stats are provided by Mike Hall's excellent FLM League Management Software. http://www.fflm.com/ for more info.   Fantasy Points Allowed by position numbers are from ESPN.com. Let's get to it. Joe /**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/ Locks:  These games feature Defenses that should be overmatched against the Offense. Atlanta's Maurice Smith vs Carolina Defense Smith was upstaged last week by big Bob Christian who looked great on the TD pass reception and run.   Smith had 43 yards on 19 carries (2.3 ypc)  Keep an eye on his health as he was nicked in Sunday's game.   Smith has been up and down but facing this Carolina defense may be what he needs.   The Panthers are ranked # 31 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks and # 29 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.   If you've been thinking about starting Smith, this could be the week. Green Bay's Ahman Green vs Detroit Defense Ahman Green was semi quiet running the ball against Atlanta last week carring 17 times for 62 yards (3.6 ypc)   He'll face a soft defense this week against the Lions.   Detroit ranks # 26 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks and # 24 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs. Green's a sure starter here. San Diego's LaDainian Tomlinson vs Arizona Defense Everyone keeps talking about the ""rookie wall"" and Tomlinson just keeps plugging.   Sunday, he posted 68 yards on 22 carries (3.1 ypc) plus a TD. Not bad.   This week, he faces the soft Cardinal defense that ranks # 23 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks and # 28 for the year in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.   If Tomlinson's been your guy, I'd certainly start him again here. Seattle's Shaun Alexander vs Kansas City Defense Alexander continues to have a bulldog like hold on the starting RB job. Coach Mike Holmgren is now softening his stance on Ricky Watters' return saying Watters might be the 3rd down back when he returns.   But even that seems to be a couple of weeks away.   Alexander is the man.   He'll face a Chief defense that ranks # 27 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks.   Alexander has to be licking his chops though at their # 31 ranking in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs. /**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/ Prime Matchups:  These games feature Defenses that should have trouble stopping the Offense. Baltimore's Jason Brookins vs Jacksonville Defense Brookins did a nice job last week against Cleveland carrying the ball 21 times for 89 yards (4.2 ypc)   I'd expect him to improve each week as he gets more comfortable in the role of #1 RB.   He didn't catch any passes so that's a little bit of a worry.   This week, he faces a Jacksonville Defense that did a pretty good against Jerome Bettis last week.   They rank # 21 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks and # 11 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.   Watch very closely how the team and self appointed spokesman Shannon Sharpe handle the Elvis Grbac 4 interceptions thing. Could lead to a more conservative gameplan with a focus on running the ball more. Cincinnati's Corey Dillon vs Cleveland Defense Corey Dillon showed last week why he gets saddled with the inconsistency rep.   17 carries for 38 yards (2.2 ypc) won't carry your team.   The sad thing is he's so hard to predict when he'll break out.   This week, he faces a Cleveland Defense that's ranked # 28 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks so you'd have to think he has a chance.   The Browns rank # 22 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs as well. Chicago's Anthony Thomas vs Minnesota Defense Thomas didn't make much noise last week with just 58 yards on 23 carries (2.5 ypc)   Fantasy owners are trying to decide who the real Thomas is. This week, he'll face a soft Viking defense that ranks # 30 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks and # 26 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.   I think we'll see him get back on track.   The Bear passing game will definitely open up some lanes for him. Miami's Lamar Smith vs Buffalo Defense The Lamar Smith woes continue.   He showed glimpses of breaking out but wound up with 53 yards on 19 carries (2.8 ypc)   I'm not as worried about Travis Minor stealing too much from him as he only managed 9 yards on 6 carries (1.5 ypc)   This Miami running game has faded quickly.   They'll face a soft Buffalo defense this week that ranks # 22 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks and # 25 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs. New York's Tiki Barber / Ron Dayne vs Oakland Defense Barber looked very good Monday while Dayne was awful.   Barber rushed 8 times for 55 yards plus he caught 4 passes for 52 yards.   Dayne, on the other hand, rushed 4 times for a whopping minus 3 ypc.   (NEGATIVE 0.8 ypc) The Raider defense isn't much ranking # 29 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks and # 19 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs so this is probably a good matchup.   At least for Barber.   I'd start Dayne at your own risk until he shows me something. New Orleans' Ricky Williams vs New England Defense Start Ricky Williams.   He's rolling.  120 yards on 28 carries (4.3 ypc) plus another 48 receiving.   The re-emergence of QB Aaron Brooks is a huge factor and Ricky should keep it up.   New England ranks # 10 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks but I wouldn't let that deter me at all. San Francisco's Garrison Hearst / Kevan Barlow vs Indianapolis Defense Hearst continued the miracle story with another fine outing last week.   He had 92 yards on 17 carries plus he caught 6 passes for 21 yards.   He looks to be too much for Kevan Barlow to overtake at this point.   Barlow did have 7 carries but it looks pretty clear that Hearst is the guy.  The Colt defense ranks # 20 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks. For the year, they rank # 27 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs. St. Louis' Marshall Faulk vs Tampa Bay Defense You don't need me to tell you to start Faulk.   Just do it and count your blessings that you own one of the best players in the universe. /**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/ Even Matchups:  These games feature no real advantage either way Arizona's Michael Pittman vs San Diego Defense Pittman ran pretty hard last week gaining 81 yards on 23 carries (3.5 ypc) but yielded a TD to Thomas Jones last week.   That's not good.   This Charger defense is definitely one that can be run on as they rank # 24 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks.   They don't give up many points though as evidenced by their # 8 ranking for the year in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.   The Arizona offense was clicking last week (albeit against Detroit) but it's a little unclear as to exactly how Pittman fits in. Carolina's Richard Huntley vs Atlanta Defense Huntley was much more involved this past week and showed his owners some signs of life.   He rushed 13 times for 63 yards (4.8 ypc) and also caught 5 passes.   Encouraging signs.   This week he faces a Falcon defense that could be primed for a letdown after the big Green Bay win.   They rank # 25 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks and # 15 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs. Dallas' Emmitt Smith vs Denver Defense Emmitt actually looked pretty good last week returning from injury to post 80 yards on 15 carries (5.3 ypc)   He was nicked late in the game so check his status this week but he looks like he'll be ok for Thursday's game. The Broncos rank # 16 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks but are still pretty strong for the year ranking # 9 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs. Denver's Mike Anderson vs Dallas Defense Anderson posted a whopping 31 yards on 13 carries (2.4 ypc) against the Redskins last week.   Olandis Gary didn't do any better with 28 yards on 10 carries (2.8 ypc)   At this point, you'd have to say the entire Bronco offense is in disarray.   WR Rod Smith's injury is a huge factor as they're simply not the same with him less than 100%.   This week, they face a pretty good defense in Dallas that ranks # 14 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 10 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.   Being a short week will not help matters. Indianapolis' Dominic Rhodes vs San Francisco Defense Dominic Rhodes didn't make anyone forget about Edgerrin James but he did prove what we all were thinking - Being the # 1 RB for Indy is not a bad thing.   He got the score and also rolled up 67 yards on 18 carries.   And he'll likely improve.   Not bad for a guy who probably wasn't drafted in your league.   The 49er defense is average ranking # 18 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 20 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs. Kansas City's Priest Holmes / Tony Richardson vs Seattle Defense After a bye week of rest, Holmes will see how he fares against the Seahawk defense.   Seattle ranks # 19 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks and # 12 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.   They're nothing special but they do a nice job of shutting down Travis Henry and Buffalo last week. Oakland's Charlie Garner / Tyrone Wheatley vs New York Giants Defense Everyone (including me) hoped that Charlie Garner would take advantage of the opportunity with Wheatley out to show he could be a full time # 1 RB. Just didn't happen.   Now Wheatley is reportedly back and ready to go and Garner looks to keep running it between the 20s while Wheatley or Zack Crockett punch it in at the goalline.   Garner still puts the yards up though.   Sunday, he rushed for 59 yards and caught another 41.   The Giants defense ranks # 13 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks and showed last night they can be vulnerable. Washington's Stephen Davis vs Philadelphia Defense Stephen Davis continues to roll up the yards.   Last week, he totaled 84 yards on 23 carries (3.7 ypc)   This week, he faces a decent Eagle defense that ranks # 17 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks and # 14 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.   Tony Banks will likely be back at QB although Kent Graham did fine. /**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/ Downside Matchups:  These games feature a Defense that could pose trouble for the Offense. Buffalo's Travis Henry / Larry Centers vs Miami Defense Travis Henry looked pretty bad last week.  13 carries for 29 yards (2.2 ypc) just isn't going to cut it for you.   Throwing 2 fumbles on top of that could put his playing time in jeopardy.  Sammy Morris and Shawn Bryson are champing at the bit.   Don't forget about Larry Centers.   He had 66 yards receiving on 8 passes Sunday and those are likely valuable stats in your league.   The Dolphin Defense ranks # 7 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks so it'll be no cakewalk. Cleveland's James Jackson / Ben Gay vs Cincinnati Defense Jackson was a late scratch from Sunday's game and Ben Gay made the most of his opportunity.   You gotta love this guy.   He's a very hard runner and while raw, displayed some nice talent.   I'm guessing Gay's play will be the best ""rehab"" Jackson could ever receive.   Jackson is reportedly ready to go against Cincinnati this week.   The Bengals are pretty tough against the run ranking # 11.   For the year, they rank # 17 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs. New England's Antowain Smith vs New Orleans Defense Smith struggled against the Rams Sunday night with 36 yards on 15 carries (2.4 ypc)   I'd expect tough going again this week against the Saints that rank # 15 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks and # 13 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.   New England seems to be coming back to earth a bit and you know the Tom Brady / Drew Bledsoe thing has to be a distraction for the team. Philadelphia's Duce Staley vs Washington Defense Any worries Duce Staley owners had about Correll Buckhalter stealing time went up in smoke last week. (sorry)   Staley looked like the Duce of old rolling up 102 yards on 26 carries.   He threw in 4 receptions for 31 yards to boot.   Washington is surprisingly tough against the run ranking # 4 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks.   It won't be a cakewalk but still you have to like Staley with the way they're playing now. Pittsburgh's Jerome Bettis vs Tennessee Defense Bettis was held very much in check last week with the exception of one 40 yard run.   Even with the big run, his totals of 52 yards on 21 carries (2.5 ypc) weren't much.   Won't be much easier this week against a good Tennesee defense that ranks # 6 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks.   The Titans shut down Corey Dillon last week who has a similar power style.   I'd have a hard time not starting Bettis though as he's definitely the focus of this offense and getting better as QB Kordell Stewart continues to improve. /**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/ Defensive Slam Dunks:  These games feature a very tough Defense posing major problems for the Offense. Detroit's James Stewart / Lamont Warren / Corey Schlesinger vs Green Bay Defense Talk about a muddy situation.   Last week, Lamont Warren, Corey Schlesinger, and Rueben Droughns each had at least 6 carries.   And just for good measure, James Stewart is reportedly ready to play this week.   Throw in the added bonus that Green Bay is very tough and ranked # 3 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks.   That's enough to make me shy away from all these guys.   (That and the fact Charlie Batch may throw it 75 times...) Jacksonville's Stacey Mack vs Baltimore Defense As we told our readers today, the news isn't good for Fred Taylor.   His doc is telling him to stay out of the lineup for this week and they're sounding way too vague for my liking as to when he'll be back.   That probably means Mack gets the call by default.   He posted a stellar 6 yard on 8 rushes (0.8 ypc) day.   Yes, ZERO point 8.   Elvis Joseph can run back kicks but he only managed 6 yards on his 3 carries.   And QB Mark Brunell could miss the game with his leg injury.   All in all, pretty ugly going against the Ravens Defense who's fallen down to # 12 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks but is still nasty. Minnesota's Michael Bennett vs Chicago Defense Bennett got the carries Monday night while Doug Chapman saw no action. Bennett had 33 yards on 11 carries (3.3 ypc) so you'd have to think he's on the right track back.   When Culpepper, Moss and Carter play like they did Monday, it's pretty clear the Vikings won't need a lot from their RB.   This week he'll face a much tougher opponent in Chicago.   The Bears rank # 5 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks and are playing very well.   For the year, they rank # 6 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs so it'll be a tough matchup coming off a short week. Tampa Bay's Warrick Dunn / Mike Alstott vs St. Louis Defense Dunn and Alstott put up pitiful numbers Sunday.   Dunn had 12 yards on 8 carries (1.5 ypc)   Alstott had 2 yards on 4 carries (0.5 ypc) although he did get a score.   Granted, it was against a tough Chicago team but that's awful.   This week, they'll face an injury riddled St. Louis team that ranks # 2 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks.   Even with the injuries, I don't like either of these RBs here. Tennessee's Eddie George vs Pittsburgh Defense It's bad when the QB out rushes the # 1 RB but that's what happened last week.   George put up 61 yards on 23 carries (2.7 ypc) and seemed to take a step back.   The trouble with him is that his game is so power oriented, that when the holes aren't there, he simply can't do much.   This week, it'll be much tougher against the swarming Steeler defense ranked # 1 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks.   They rank # 3 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.   I'm not one for benching your best players but this is one matchup you'll want to look at very closely. /**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/ That'll do it for the Rushing Matchups.

Joe /**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/ Upgrades QB - Aaron Brooks - Brooks and the Saints offense are clicking now and Brooks' fantasy owners must be ecstatic.  Brooks has scored multiple touchdowns in 3 of the last 4 weeks and I expect this trend to continue for the remainder of the season.  With an easier schedule and better decision making, Brooks has been able to connect with Aaron Brooks, Willie Jackson and breakout tight end Boo Williams. QB - Jeff Garcia - Garcia continues to put up exceptional numbers.  He has thrown for 3 or more touchdowns in 5 of the last 6 games.  I wouldn't bench Garcia in favor of any quarterback in the league right now.  He is a stud. QB - Charlie Batch - Batch's 436 yard, 3 touchdown performance deserves recognition.  However, I still think Batch will see bench time as the Lions give backup Mike McMahon some playing time towards the end of the season for the winless Lions.  A tough schedule remains for Batch and the Lions as Green Bay, Chicago (2), Tampa Bay and Pittsburgh are left on the schedule. QB - Rich Gannon - A strong performance on Sunday with 311 yards and 4 touchdowns proves Gannon and the Raiders offense is the team to beat in the AFC.  With Tim Brown and Jerry Rice looking fantastic, Gannon will continue to post good numbers for the remainder of the season. QB - Kurt Warner - Warner looked good on Sunday night with 401 yards and 3 touchdowns.  More importantly, he did not appear to be hampered by a thumb injury that has been nagging him throughout the season.  As always, keep Warner in your starting lineup. QB - Jake Plummer - Plummer looked good on Sunday with 334 passing yards and 4 touchdowns.  Keep in mind, this performance was against the hapless Lions. Look for Plummer to return to his normal erratic self in the next two weeks against San Diego and Oakland.  Plummer might be a good option for playoff weeks as he faces Dallas in week 15 and Carolina in week 16. RB - Shaun Alexander - Plain and simple, Alexander produces when he is in the lineup.  He scored his 10th touchdown of the season on Sunday and nearly cleared 100 yards once again.  Look for Alexander to remain the starter once Watters returns from injury. RB -  Duce Staley - Staley continues to look better and better.  The 133 total yards on Sunday will be a sign of things to come for Staley in the second half of the season.  Philadelphia's offense and a rock solid defense will keep the Eagles in the lead in the majority of games.  With Correll Buckhalter in trouble with a team suspension due to marijuana, Staley will not lose many carries to Buckhalter. RB - Warrick Dunn - Dunn managed just 12 yards rushing against a solid Bears defense, but a 12 catch, 138 yard receiving performance helps vault him into the upgrades section.  More importantly, it appears that Dunn has returned to 100% after being hampered by foot and hamstring injuries. RB - Garrison Hearst - Hearst nearly reached the 100-yard plateau once again.  He has looked good the last few weeks and should continue this trend for the remainder of the season.  The 49ers offense continues to look good and a favorable schedule gives Hearst the advantage over a majority of starting running backs in the league. RB - Ricky Williams - The Saints offense is looking sharp and efficient. With Brooks making wise decisions, the offense will continue to get better and this will lead to more scoring opportunities for Williams.  Williams has topped the 120 yard mark in consecutive weeks.  Look for this trend to continue as the Saints have a favorable schedule in the second half of the season. WR - Marty Booker - The Bears finally starting passing the ball downfield and Booker's statistics were directly affected.  He burned the Buccaneers for 3 long touchdowns on the day and made it look rather easy.  Look for more longer passes out of the Bears in the second half of the season.  With teams starting to ""sell out"" to the run, Booker and Miller should connect on some play action pass touchdowns. WR - Joe Horn - Horn remains one of the hottest receivers in the league with 8 catches for 148 yards on Sunday.  With Aaron Brooks making wiser decisions, the New Orleans offense has started putting touchdowns on the board.  Although this may be bad news for John Carney owners, it is good news for Horn, Ricky Williams, and Willie Jackson. WR - Jerry Rice - With Tim Brown receiving the majority of attention from defenses, Rice will continue to be effective on the other side of the field. The career touchdown leader added 3 more to his total on Sunday and made it look rather easy.  With the Oakland offense looking good, Rice should continue to see scoring chances.  A good option for a 3rd wide receiver in your lineup. WR - Peerless Price - With 10 catches and 138 yards receiving on Sunday, Price continues to outperform Eric Moulds in the Bills offense and have many fantasy owners questioning who is the number one receiver in Buffalo.  With Eric Moulds being shut down with double teams, Price has quietly scored 5 touchdowns on the season.  Price is a talented receiver and should continue to score a touchdown every other week. WR - Hines Ward - Ward has amassed 26 catches in his last 3 games. He has only scored two touchdowns on the season, but his reception and yardage numbers are becoming a consistent factor on a weekly basis.  I've never been a big fan of the Steelers passing game, but Ward deserves consideration for active duty on a weekly basis. WR - David Boston - Boston's 100-yard game streak ended this week.  Fantasy owners had to settle for 80 yards receiving and 2 touchdowns.  Look for Boston to continue to put up quality numbers. /**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/ Downgrades QB - Brian Griese - The ankle injury to Rod Smith had me worried a little bit heading into Sunday's game, so I was not surprised by Griese's poor performance on Sunday.  With Smith hobbled by injuries and McCaffrey out for the year, Griese's receiving options were limited and his production was directly affected.  You may want to consider benching Griese until Smith is healthy.  However, the Broncos do play Dallas on Thanksgiving. QB - Tim Couch - Couch threw 3 interceptions and was held to 144 passing yards against a stingy Ravens defense.  Couch should be considered a quality keeper quarterback, but the Browns schedule will make Couch an inconsistent quarterback for the remainder of this season.  Couch should do well against Cincinnati and Jacksonville, but struggle against New England, Green Bay and Pittsburgh. QB - Mark Brunell - An injured quad injury kept Brunell out of the lineup this week.  With an unfavorable matchup against Baltimore this week, it may be best to start someone else this week. QB - Elvis Grbac - Grbac looked horrible with 4 interceptions on Sunday. The week was not a total disappointment for Grbac as he threw 2 touchdown passes. The schedule looks favorable for Grbac, but he is struggling, which concerns me. QB - Tony Banks - Banks suffered a concussion in Sunday's game against Denver.  The injury looked severe as Banks was slammed to the ground and then taken off the field on a stretcher. QB - Jay Fiedler - Fiedler threw 3 interceptions and 2 touchdowns on Sunday. Unfortunately, Fiedler's two touchdowns were scored by the Jets defense. The up and down season for Fiedler continues.  With games against Buffalo, Indianapolis and San Francisco left on the schedule, Fiedler should still be considered a quality ""spot starter"". RB - Eddie George - George was held to 61 yards on 23 carries Sunday.  He has yet to break the 100-yard barrier in a game this season.  I guess the toe injury in the preseason affected his performance more than most anticipated.  Although we can blame the toe injury, two other factors have meant the demise of George this season.  First, the loss of lead back Lorenzo Neal has minimized running lanes.  Finally, the Titans offensive line is not giving George the quality run blocking of the previous seasons. RB - Anthony Thomas - Thomas was held under 60 yards for the second consecutive game.  With opposing defenses focusing on stopping the run, Thomas will continue to find the running room a little tougher throughout the remainder of the season.  Keep in mind, the Bears last two opponents (Green Bay and Tampa Bay) are two of the better defenses against the run in the league.  With Tampa Bay, Green Bay, Minnesota and Detroit (2) on the schedule for the remainder of the season, expect Thomas' stats to be up and down. RB - Lamar Smith - With 53 rushing yards on 19 carries, Smith continues to struggle.  This marks the 5th consecutive game that Smith has been held 3 yards/carry.  Don't be surprised if the Dolphins give Travis Minor a larger role in the running game. RB - Travis Henry - Henry continues to struggle.  He managed just 29 yards on 13 carries this past Sunday and had a crucial fumble.  A running back can not be productive with just 13 carries.  Keep him on your bench. WR - Rod Smith - Suffering from an ankle injury, Smith was limited to 25 yards on three catches.  He did manage to score a touchdown.  Smith's ankle injury deserved your attention.  The Broncos kept Smith on the sidelines late in the 4th quarter while the team was attempting to drive down the field and tie the ball game.  The short week will not help Smith's status on Thanksgiving Day. WR - Eric Moulds - The disappointing season for Moulds continues.  He was held to 61 yards on Sunday while Peerless Price gained 138 on the other side of the field.  Moulds may not even be the best fantasy option on the Bills at this point. WR - Wayne Chrebet - A shoulder injury to Chrebet limited his production on Sunday.  Testaverde and the passing game isn't looking very good at this point.  You may want to bench Chrebet until he is 100% healthy. WR - Todd Pinkston - Pinkston has become a regular on the downgrade list. Heck, I like the guy and think he could become special.  However, he remains to do what is needed....produce on a consistent basis. WR - Muhsin Muhammad - Muhammad suffered a sprained shoulder and was unable to play in the second half against San Francisco.  Heck, his production was not missed.  It's pretty difficult to miss little to no production, if you know what I mean.  If you're a Muhammad owner, you know what I mean. WR - Reggie Wayne - Wayne suffered a sprained knee on Sunday and his status is not yet known.  He has yet to do anything special this season, but his expectations were fairly high, so I'll downgrade him /**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/ Waiver Wire Keep in mind, the waiver wire analysis selections are based off of 12 and 14 team leagues. QB - Alex Van Pelt - Van Pelt stepped in the lineup and looked good on Sunday with 316 passing yards and two touchdowns.  He has a talented receiving crew with Moulds, Price and Riemersma.  As long as he can get pass protection, his production could be a welcome addition to fantasy teams in need of a quarterback. RB - Ben Gay - Gay was the feature back on Sunday with 18 carries for 56 yards and a touchdown against a quality Baltimore Ravens defense.  No other running back has taken over the reigns of the Browns rushing offense.  Gay may just be that guy. RB - Amos Zeroue - Although he suffered a sprained shoulder against the Browns, Zeroue is expected to return to the team this week against Jacksonville.  If you have Jerome Bettis on your team, Zeroue deserves a roster spot.  If not, you may want to take a flyer on this guy.  The Steelers have a solid running game and an injury to Bettis would open the door for Zeroue to produce quality numbers. RB - Lamont Jordan - Jordan is in a similar situation as Zeroue.  If Curtis Martin gets injured, Jordan would enter the lineup and produce quality numbers.  Not a bad option, if you can spare a roster spot.  If you have Curtis Martin, get Lamont Jordan. WR - JJ Stokes - Stokes looked good on Sunday with 72 yards and a touchdown. This marks the second consecutive game with 72 yards.  With the 49ers looking good in the passing game, a healthy Stokes could be a decent ""spot starter"". WR - Keith Poole - Poole was unable to do anything on Sunday against the Redskins.  However, he continues to learn the offense and should start producing very shortly.  Poole's effectiveness will most likely occur with a healthy Rod Smith garnering double/triple teams on the opposite side of the field. TE - ""Boo"" Williams - ""Boo"" has me excited about his potential.  He's a big, fast tight end with good hands.  Plain and simple, he has big play potential and should produce in the Saints offense. /**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/ Bryant Analytics, Inc.

Smith could face disciplinary action from the NFL for violating the league's substance abuse policy. NFL spokesman Dan Masonson said the league was reviewing Smith's case. Smith denied having taken cocaine, and said he was trying to figure out how the test could have returned positive. ""I've never done it, don't do it and don't plan to do it,"" Smith said. ""I just hate for my name to be associated with anything like that, ever. Since I've been here, I've been a good role model, and I will continue to be a good role model. It's devastating to me and my family, but life goes on."" Coach Tom Coughlin said Smith told him he did not take cocaine. ""This is a person I've had a long relationship with,"" Coughlin said. ""He looks me in the eye and tells me he didn't do it, I'm going to believe it."" Smith passed two breath tests after he was stopped, but police took a urine sample, which was sent to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement for analysis. Smith tested positive for cocaine, Assistant State Attorney John Guy said Monday. Guy said his office would not prosecute Smith for drunken driving because he did not have a blood-alcohol level above the state's .08 limit. Smith also will not be prosecuted on drug charges. ""He didn't have anything on his person when he was arrested,"" Guy said. ""There was only cocaine in his system, and for that I can't prosecute."" Smith, who has been to the last four Pro Bowls, was third in the AFC in receptions with 70 this season -- one in which most people didn't think he would play. He had three abdominal operations in the off-season, lost about 20 pounds and spent about a month in the hospital. [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [  OUR VIEW  ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] This is something that's been rumored for the last few days and looks like the rumors had some merit behind them.   You'll have to wait to see how it shakes out.   Tough news all the way around but it's still very unclear what (if any) action the league will take.   More as we hear it.

This realignment will help to strengthen the commercial focus and communication between the trading desks and the schedulers and will play a critical role as Enron tries to maximize opportunities and maintain a competitive trading edge. The details are as follows: Wholesale Bob Superty will maintain his management of the Logistics support functions which include the Transport Rate team (Kim Olinger), Electronic Commerce team (Tammy Lee-Jaquet) and Regulatory Affairs teams (Suzanne Calcagno). In addition, Bob will now manage the Northeast Logistics team as part of the East desk. Bob will report directly to Scott Neal and will also help coordinate the Logistics function across all regions working closely with each of the regional Logistics Managers, Commercial desk heads and Enron Americas senior management team.  Victor LaMadrid will manage the Southeast Logistics team and will report directly to Scott Neal. Victor's knowledge and overall east desk experience will be critical to help  maximize east desk opportunities and promote new initiatives across all regions.  Lisa Kinsey will manage the Central Logistics team and will report directly to Hunter Shively. Patti Sullivan will manage the West Logistics team and will report directly to Mike Grigsby. Darren Farmer will manage the Texas Logistics team and will report directly to Tom Martin  George Smith will manage the Well Head Logistics team and will report directly to Fred Lagrasta.   Retail  Donna Greif will now report directly to Don Black. Each of the regional Logistics Managers (East - Marde Driscoll-Ernest, Central - Charlie Muzzy, West - Sabra Dinari) will continue to report directly to Donna. Donna will continue her ongoing efforts in the development and integration of the new retail trading systems, prior period adjustments and development of a strong and talented Logistics team.   Congratulations to all involved and welcome to the commercial gas team - John Lavorato, President and CEO, Enron Americas.  _____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________  Assistants - Please forward on to your groups.  subject: Logistics Commercial Realignment "

Moe Williams will probably become Baltimore's No. 1 RB now, and the Ravens may add another RB to their roster in the next few days. [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [  OUR VIEW  ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] Don't expect something goofy like a Barry Sanders or Robert Smith to come to the rescue.   I'd expect to see Moe Williams and FB Obafemi Ayanbadejo should have an increased role.   I expected good things from Williams when Brian Billick acquired him and had been disappointed he hadn't seen much action.   Now he has a golden opportunity.   Also remember Terry Allen will be back from the hand injury (latest word is week 14) so don't go crazy. Thanks to Footballguy Rich Voakes for pointing me to this one.

ken.shulklapper@enron.com,1,1,0.894,f8580f8b-fa3a-4a2a-a92b-f02f891549d5,"body: Don't know if you saw this already.  Interesting. Ken Indigestion  Daniel Fisher, Forbes Magazine, 10.29.01  All those new natural gas-fired electric plants mean more gas demand, right? Maybe not. For natural gas bulls, there was never a surer sign of good times to come than the order book at General Electric Corp. Backlogs in GE's Power Systems group almost tripled to $25 billion in the late 1990s as scores of utilities and freestanding power producers ordered natural gas turbines to supply the nation's growing appetite for electricity. Gas demand had to go up as all those shiny new turbines were connected to the grid.  Ah, but there was a flaw in that argument--one that is becoming glaringly clear as the price of gas plunges below $2 per million Btu at the wellhead from as high as $10 last year. (A million Btu of gas equals just about 1,000 cubic feet.) Those new gas plants were supposed to steal business from pollution-spewing coal units, which still supply half the nation's electricity. But in a painstaking study of 788 power plants that supply the bulk of U.S. electricity, Charles Studness, president of Studness Research, found quite the opposite could happen.  Studness determined that 79% of the ""new"" electricity supplied to the grid over the past five years came from existing plants, mostly coal-fired units. And there's plenty more where that came from. Studness figures existing coal plants have the potential to increase output by 50 million megawatt-hours a year for the next five years, representing about half the expected 2.5%-a-year increase in demand.  Coal's advantage over gas: It's cheap. Utilities paid an average of $1.20 per million Btu for coal last year, compared with $4.30 for gas (delivered). Even with depressed gas prices, many coal plants are still cheaper to operate. So while those new turbines being installed by Calpine (nyse: CPN - news - people) and other independent power producers, (see table, below) will burn a lot of gas, they will do it mostly at the expense of older gas plants that burn half again as much.    Addressing a Burning Issue  If natural gas prices stay down or merely remain volatile it will help companies that burn, trade or store gas and hurt those that sell it or provide equipment to the industry. Overleveraged gas producers and service companies could have trouble making it through the downturn.

Source: Market Guide via FactSet Research Systems.  ""It's not our game to compete with coal or nuclear,"" says Ron A. Walter, senior vice president of San Jose, Calif.-based Calpine, which plans over the next few years to build gas-fired plants totaling 31,500 megawatts. ""It's our game to displace older gas.""  Combined-cycle gas turbines, which use hot exhaust gases from one turbine to generate steam to turn a second one, can transform 6,800 Btu of gas into a kilowatt-hour of electricity, enough to light one lightbulb for ten hours. The oldest gas plants burn as much as 13,000 Btu, and the national average is 10,500. Substitute enough new plants for old, and U.S. gas consumption, currently 62 billion cubic feet a day, could drop by as much as 1 billion cubic feet a day.  That scenario sounds unlikely to Stephen Bergstrom, president of Houston-based Dynegy, an energy-trading firm that also owns both coal- and gas-fired power plants. Dynegy's 35-year-old coal plants are ""huge capital hogs,"" Bergstrom says, that cost ten times as much to maintain as modern gas units. Throw in the cost of scrubbers and other required pollution controls, and many smaller coal plants will have to be shut down, Bergstrom says.  But coal-plant owners can be ingenious. Witness Midwest Generation, a nonregulated subsidiary of Edison International that bought six coal plants from troubled Commonwealth Edison of Chicago in 1999. By changing operating procedures and burning a higher grade of coal, Midwest boosted output from the 40-year-old plants 12% last year--while reducing emissions. John Long, vice president and chief technical officer of the Midwest Generation unit, thinks he can coax another 15% increase out of those aging boilers over the next five years without running afoul of environmental rules.  Long term, the bullish scenario still holds: Gas will displace coal. In the meantime, gas producers have a lot of bonds to retire.  subject: Forbes Article-Gas Fired Power Plants "

bryant@cheatsheets.net,0,0,0.891,5d0074f1-9232-45aa-990a-f5077155e083,"body: Hi Folks, Here's how I see the matchups this week. PLEASE NOTE:   See the cheatsheets online at www.footballguys.com  for exactly where I rank players and to determine who to start.   I always receive emails asking me how I can have a guy ranked highly on the cheatsheet but listed under a matchup that favors the Defense.   Just because one matchup may be more favorable than another, that doesn't necessarily mean I'd start the player with the best matchup.   Peyton Manning may have a horrible matchup one week but unless you're sitting on Kurt Warner or Daunte Culpepper, Manning's your guy no matter who he's lining up against.   The matchup info is meant to be just one more tool in your box when it comes to deciding between players. Note:  I've used the player stats sorted by performance over the last four weeks extensively in developing these write-ups. Stats are provided by Mike Hall's excellent FLM League Management Software.  http://www.fflm.com/ for more info. Let's get to it. Joe /**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/ Locks:  These games feature Defenses that should be overmatched against the Offense. New Orleans Passing Game vs Atlanta Defense A good dose of the Atlanta Defense may be just what New Orleans and QB Aaron Brooks needed.   The Falcons are awful ranking # 31 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   They rank # 29 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs.   Brooks will be throwing to WRs Joe Horn and Willie Jackson.   Albert Connell is there but not a big factor.   Of course, the biggest news from last week was the awakening of TE Cam Cleeland.   He could play a big role if he get's fired up. Green Bay Passing Game vs Minnesota Defense You have little choice but to start Brett Favre.   Last week, he hung 3 TDs on the Ravens so I think he can handle the Vikings.   WR Antonio Freeman awoke from a slumber and did it in a big way.   The question of the week is can he continue?   Part of his success can be attributed to his public demand for more passes (which Favre said he approved of and made good on his promises to target Freeman more)   Although an ankle injury to WR Bill Schroeder was no doubt a factor as well.   It looks like Schroeder will play but the ankle is still sore.   If Schroeder can go, both look to be a good start against the Viking's defense ranked # 28 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   They're also # 28 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.   TE Bubba Franks is a must start as it seems every pass he catches is for a TD. Jacksonville Passing Game vs Buffalo Defense After a hot start, it seems like it's been forever since the Jaguars have scored a passing TD.   That should change this week as they face a soft Buffalo Defense that ranks # 25 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   They're even worse when it comes to Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs ranking # 28.   Pretty much all the Jaguar skill positions look good here.   WRs Jimmy Smith and Keenan McCardell are must starts. They'll be too much for Cornerbacks Ken Irvin and Antoine Winfield.   TE Kyle Brady is a nice play here too.   He was the target of 5 passes in week 4. Kansas City Passing Game vs Arizona Defense A game against Arizona may be just what the disappointing Chiefs need. Trent Green's been nowhere near as good as everyone (including us) hoped but I'm not sure it's all his fault.   He's had trouble keeping a WR Corps healthy and teams are doubling and tripling TE Tony Gonzalez, their best player.   Priest Holmes has put a spark in the running game and that'll help.   WR Derrick Alexander only caught one pass last week but he had 8 thrown his way so he's getting the opportunities.   He'll likely make much better use of his chances this week against a Cardinal team that ranks # 22 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   They rank # 26 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs so Green could break out as well. /**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/ Prime Matchups:  These games feature Defenses that should have trouble stopping the Offense. Tennessee Passing Game vs Detroit Defense Steve McNair awoke last week and played a very solid game against Tampa Bay throwing for 230 yards and 1 TD.   He'll have a much easier time this week against a Lion team that's hurting in the secondary.   Detroit ranks # 13 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks but they're vulnerable.  They rank # 29 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.   WR Kevin Dyson is probably the best bet for WRs.   Derrick Mason is still nursing a bad ankle and his status isn't clear yet.   Chris Sanders could see time too and he's been targeted some lately.   Of course, the favorite receiver is still TE Frank Wycheck. St. Louis Passing Game vs New York Jets Defense Just start your Rams.   Warner, Holt, Bruce and probably Hakim and TE Conwell all deserve starting status.   Until I see it again, I'm calling the Giants game of last week an aberration.   The Jets defense ranks # 20 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks but I'd start these guys against the AFC Pro Bowl Team. Pittsburgh Passing Game vs Tampa Bay Defense This could be an ugly game for the Steeler passing game.   Tampa plays primarily zone defense which means Stewart will be forced to pick his spots from the pocket.   And we all know, the pocket is no friend to Stewart who is best when he can run a little.   Man coverage allows a QB more freedom to tuck and run with defenders in coverage.   He will face a tough Defense with the talent to hold down WRs Hines Ward and Plaxico Burress.   On the plus side, Tampa's given up a lot of yards to the passing game though ranking # 30 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   They rank # 23 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs so the potential is there for Stewart to do something, I'm just not sure what it'll be . Carolina Passing Game vs Washington Defense QB Chris Weinke gets better each week.   Is he playing well enough to carry your team right now?   Probably not.   But he might start getting there. The Redskins  rank # 24 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   Weinke's primary targets will be WR Muhsin Muhammad and TE Wesley Walls.   Both should have decent opportunities this week.   On the upside, Washington Cornerback Fred Smoot will likely be limited if he even plays with a bad knee. Denver Passing Game vs San Diego Defense QB Brian Griese has complained of shoulder pain all week and missed early practices but says he'll play Sunday.   Gus Frerotte will go if Griese can't.   Good luck getting a straight answer out of Skeletor Shanahan (love that guy) but if I had to guess, I'd play him.   Weigh it out though if you have another solid option of course.   The Chargers are looking suddenly very beatable after New England's Tom Brady hung 364 yards and 2 TDs on them.   The key will be Eddie Kennison staying on a roll.   He takes the incredible pressure off Rod Smith and can stretch the defense keeping Safety Rodney Harrison back where he belongs and off the line.   San Diego ranks # 18 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks but can definitely be thrown on. Detroit Passing Game vs Tennessee Defense What got into Charlie Batch?   Whatever it is, let's hope he can keep it up. He posted some great numbers last week with 345 yards, 3 TDs and most importantly, 0 interceptions.   He'll try to keep it rolling against a suspect Titan defense that's ranked # 27 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   They're ranked # 24 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs.   Cornerback Samari Rolle is out again and that hurts.   Germane Crowell may not know when to run out of bounds but he can rack up the yards. Look for him to do it again.   Johnnie Morton will man the other spot and do well.   In minor news, it looks like Herman Moore is done for the year with a torn muscle in his hip. /**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/ Even Matchups:  These games feature no real advantage either way Washington Passing Game vs Carolina Defense Are you really down to this?   If so, Tony Banks may be ok this week. Carolina ranks # 26 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   And they're the worst team in the league in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs.   Still though, I hate to think I'm putting too much faith in these guys.   WR Rod Gardner is getting more looks than anyone at this point. Michael Westbrook scored last week and maybe he can build on that.   TE Stephen Alexander is out with a bad ankle. San Diego Passing Game vs Denver Defense Flutie's fun to watch but make sure to understand this team is about RB LaDainian Tomlinson.   I hear some comparisons to Denver's John Elway finding a young Terrell Davis but this isn't the same.   Flutie just won't put up the stats consistently.   Curtis Conway, Tim Dwight and Jeff Graham are all seeing about the same amount of work and that makes it tough to pick one.   Unfortunately, TE Freddie Jones has been very inconsistent and frustrating for his owners.   I'm not sure that will change.   The Broncos are pretty solid against the pass ranking # 12 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.  They rank # 11 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs. Philadelphia Passing Game vs New York Giants Defense With a week off to prepare, look for the Eagles to come out firing. Somewhat like Green Bay did last week against Baltimore, look for them to focus on the pass against a defense that is extremely good against the run. They'll have their work cut out for them though.   The Giants pass defense has been up and down.   Of course, lately, they've been very up holding the high flying Rams to a mere mortal 15 points and no passing TDs.   That's strong.   But they rank just # 18 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   They're a little tougher on QBs ranking # 10 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs.   Donovan McNabb has two solid under rated WRs in Todd Pinkston and James Thrash that can stretch the field.   TE Chad Lewis has been seeing a lot of balls thrown his way and could do damage here. New England Passing Game vs Indianapolis Defense Tom Brady continues to impress as he gains confidence in the system.   He'll go against the Colts this week who have to be wondering where their Super Bowl aspirations have gone.   The key in my opinion is WR Terry Glenn who brings an entirely new dimension to this team.   Brady threw the ball his way 14 times last week.   Troy Brown is a quiet option but he gets a ton of targets (16 last week)   The Colts rank # 14 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks but rank # 8 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs. Chicago Passing Game vs Cincinnati Defense I'm looking for Jim Miller to bounce back from an awful game last week against Arizona.   The Bengal defense is pretty solid ranking # 8 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   They'll be without Cornerback Rodney Heath.   Corner Robert Bean is probable with a leg injury so he's likely less than 100%.   The Bengals rank # 18 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs so that's some encouragement.   WR Marcus Robinson will have a size advantage on the Bengal Corners and watch for Marty Booker who was the target of more passes last week than was Robinson. /**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/ Downside Matchups:  These games feature a Defense that could pose trouble for the Offense. New York Jets Passing Game vs St. Louis Defense With every passing week, it becomes more and more clear that this ""new"" offense is really just a slightly different way to get Curtis Martin the ball.   And that's the smart move for Jet's fans.   Vinny Testeverde draws a pretty tough matchup this week in the Rams who rank # 9 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.  They rank # 19 in in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs.   Laveranues Coles has been getting plenty of looks and is a good play.   Wayne Chrebet will handle the intermediate stuff as he always does. Atlanta Passing Game vs New Orleans Defense Chris Chandler still has plenty left in the tank (as long as he can protect his head)   The Saints could cause trouble with an aggressive blitzing defense that's recorded 12 sacks already.   That Super Dome floor isn't much softer than the carpet covered concrete of the Georgia Dome so injury is always a worry.   New Orleans is tough ranking # 11 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   They rank # 13 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs.   Look for Chandler to focus on Terance Mathis and Shawn Jefferson as he did last week although Jefferson is risky listed as questionable with ankle / toe problems. Buffalo Passing Game vs Jacksonville Defense Will the week off benefit Rob Johnson?   I really don't know.   You know by now that I'm down on Johnson.   He does have two potentially very good WRs though in Eric Moulds and Peerless Price.   Both have underachieved this season and it's hard to know whether to blame them or Johnson. Jacksonville is average defending the pass ranking # 15 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   They're much tougher in shutting down QBs though as they rank # 2 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs. Cornerback Fernando Bryant is Questionable with a bad foot and that'll be a big plus for the Bills if he can't go. Cincinnati Passing Game vs Chicago Defense It may not seem like a big deal, but the Bengals will miss WR Chad Johnson who's out with a broken collarbone.   He was a true deep threat that took heat off of Darnay Scott and freed up Peter Warrick underneath.   We'll see how they work without him.   Jon Kitna continues to play a Trent Dilfer like ""good enough to win"" game and I don't see that changing a lot.   The Bengals would love to get games like last week's 201 yard, 1 TD and 0 interception (the biggie) out of Kitna.   This offense is all about RB Corey Dillon. The Bears are tougher against the run than they are the pass.   Chicago ranks # 19 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks. They bring a tough pass rush with 11 sacks in their last 3 games.   All in all, a pretty tough matchup. Cleveland Passing Game vs Baltimore Defense Green Bay showed last week one way to beat Baltimore was to concede the running game and focus on throwing the ball.   That's fine as long as you have Brett Favre under center.   Tim Couch may one day be very good, but he's a long ways from Favre today.   The Ravens rank # 10 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks so they can be thrown on.   Kevin Johnson has been hot for the Browns and Quincy Morgan is getting almost as many balls thrown his way as Johnson.   The Ravens bring two very good Cornerbacks in Duane Starks and Chris McAlister that'll make it a tough game for the Browns. Indianapolis Passing Game vs New England Defense If you can afford to bench Peyton Manning, you're deep enough at QB that you don't need our help.   The Patriots are pretty tough ranking # 7 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   They also rank # 6 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs.   I'd still start Manning unless I had a great option though.   He's just too liable to have a great game against anyone.   Same for Marvin Harrison.   Jerome Pathon is still very iffy for this week and I'd avoid.   Rookie Reggie Wayne is still learning the ropes and had 3 passes thrown his way last week.  I'm not counting on a whole lot yet from him. /**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/ Defensive Slam Dunks:  These games feature a very tough Defense posing major problems for the Offense. Tampa Bay Passing Game vs Pittsburgh Defense Must be something in the Nashville water that awoke both Steve McNair and Brad Johnson last week.   Johnson finally listened to Keyshawn and threw him the ball 17 times Sunday.   Both Johnsons had strong games and hopefully the light flicked on for Brad Johnson.   Jacquez Green had several looks but clearly, this is a Johnson and Johnson team now.   The Steelers are very tough against the pass ranking # 3 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   They rank # 3 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs as well so it's pretty clear that it's a tough matchup for the Bucs. New York Giants Passing Game vs Philadelphia Defense After a heartbreaking loss to the Rams, the Giants face a very tough Eagle pass defense that's ranked # 1 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   They rank # 5 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs so it'll be tough going for the Giants here.   QB Kerry Collins hasn't been anything special lately and look for the Eagles to continue their huge array of blitzes that they love.   He'll be throwing to Amani Toomer who needs to pick up the pace he started with early.   Ike Hilliard is back but still not seeing as many passes thrown his way as Joe Jurevicius. Minnesota Passing Game vs Green Bay Defense For all the anti Viking talk, Culpepper continues to post some excellent Fantasy Stats.   His rushing TDs are huge in many scoring systems.   Of course, the big question this week is the health of Randy Moss' ankle. Coach Denny Green came out this week and said Moss has been limited by the effects of his ankle sprain suffered before his rookie season.   I personally would come up with something better than that...   Denny Green is a player's coach and it wouldn't surprise me at all if this were primarily a protection move for his star WR.   I'd fully expect Moss to play but certainly, he's a risk.   The Packers are very tough against the pass ranking # 4 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks. They're also # 4 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs.   With RB Michael Bennett out this week, the Vikings will likely be throwing all day so you know they'll be getting the opportunities.   It's a very tough matchup though. Arizona Passing Game vs Kansas City Defense Plummer's always a roll of the dice and this week isn't any different. He'll face a KC defense that's very tough statistically against the pass ranking # 3 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks. When it comes to Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs, they rank # 7.   David Boston is clearly Plummer's best option and he'll match up pretty well with the Chiefs.  MarTay Jenkins and Frank Sanders will see some action but you'll be hard pressed to start them I'd think.   Probably a risky matchup this week for a Cardinal team that's suspect in talent to begin with. Baltimore Passing Game vs Cleveland Defense Elvis Grbac returned back to reality last week with a disappointing game against the Packers.   He was held to 138 yards, 1 TD and 2 Interceptions also suffering a neck injury / concussion.   He's listed as probable and should improve upon those numbers this week but not by a lot.   The Browns are tough against the pass ranking # 6 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   More impressively, they rank # 1 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs.   Cornerbacks Daylon McCutcheon and Corey Fuller should do a pretty nice job of matching up with WRs Travis Taylor and Qadry Ismail.   Of course, Shannon Sharpe is always a threat.   Bottom line, this is a tough matchup for Baltimore. /**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/ Bryant Analytics, Inc.

Just because one matchup may be more favorable than another, that doesn't necessarily mean I'd start the player with the best matchup.   Ahman Green may have a horrible matchup one week but unless you're sitting on Edgerrin James or Marshall Faulk, Green's your guy no matter who he's lining up against.

Joe /**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/ Locks:  These games feature Defenses that should be overmatched against the Offense. Kansas City's Priest Holmes vs Arizona Defense The bright spot for the Chiefs offense was Holmes last week as he rolled up 150 yards on 20 carries for a 7.5 ypc average plus 2 TDs.   Not a bad day against a very good Pittsburgh defense.   This week, it'll be considerably easier against the Cardinals.   Arizona ranks # 27 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks and # 29 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs. They make everyone look good and that likely won't change this week. There's also a chance Tony Richardson could play this week St. Louis' Trung Canidate / Marshall Faulk vs New York Jets Defense Faulk owners had quite a scare this week.   Over a 24 hour period, his injury status went from 4 weeks to 2 weeks to possibly playing in this week's game.   To make matters more frustrating, the Jets are weak defending the run ranking # 29 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks.  They're # 26 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.   They did look better last week though but I still think they're very vulnerable.   Trung Canidate will likely get the start and he could shine if given the opportunity.   That system and surrounding cast is so good I'm not sure I couldn't put decent numbers there.   If I had another option outside of Faulk, I'd probably go there as it's very risky to look for anything from him.   If I had Canidate, this could be the game to start him. Jacksonville's Stacey Mack / Frank Moreau / Elvis Joseph vs Buffalo Defense Tough call of the week here.   With Fred Taylor still out, my guess is it'll be Mack getting the start.   Until he fumbles or fails to produce.   Both of which have a pretty good chance of happening.   Then you'll see Frank Moreau and our guy Elvis Joseph.   You may see a good bit of Moreau anyway.   The frustrating thing is that the Bills matchup is so attractive.   They rank # 30 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks and # 28 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.   I'd go with Mack if you're in the gambling mood as he just might pay off against that defense. Arizona's Michael Pittman vs Kansas City Defense Check Pittman's status this week as he's dealing with a concussion (that he played through during the game)   Early this week, he was still having headaches but I'd be surprised if doesn't get the bulk of the carries. Thomas Jones had only 6 carries for 14 yards last week and I don't see that changing a lot.   Pittman ran for 50 yards on 16 carries (3.1 ypc) but the Chicago defense is very tough.   This week, he'll face a much softer KC unit that ranks just # 28 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks.   When it comes to Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs, they rank # 20 for the year.   I'm not too discouraged with last week's poor showing since the Chicago D is very tough on the run and I think you may see Pittman perform better this week. Carolina's Tshimanga Biakabutuka / Richard Huntley vs Washington Defense If you've been wondering if you should ever start Biakabutuka, here's your chance.   The Redskins rank # 31 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks.   They also are worst in the league in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.   On the flip side, Biakabutuka struggled against a tough New Orleans defense last week gaining just 30 yards on 13 carries (2.3 ypc) The biggest stat though was that he did have another fumble.   We've seen already that Coach Seifert won't put up with much of that.   Bottom line is that it's a great matchup but I seriously wonder about Biakabutuka's ability to capitalize on it. /**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/ Prime Matchups:  These games feature Defenses that should have trouble stopping the Offense. Tennessee's Eddie George vs Detroit Defense Look for Eddie George to build on his positive performance from last week where her rushed for 85 yards on 29 carries (2.9 ypc) against the Bucs. He'll find the going easier against a Lion defense that ranks # 21 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks.   They rank # 25 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.   They're improving, but clearly, they haven't been able to stop many people.   George isn't his old self but he may be getting there.   The improved play of QB Steve McNair was the big news from last week and he needs to keep it rolling to take heat off the running game. Baltimore's Terry Allen / Jason Brookins vs Cleveland Defense Jason Brookins is breathing down his neck but Allen's hanging pretty tough. The veteran shows little signs of wearing down.   Against a very good Green Bay defense last week, he ran for 75 yards on 18 carries (4.2 ypc) Brookins totaled 33 yards on 9 carries for 3.7 ypc but here's a very disturbing stat for Allen owners.   As you can see from our Red Zone data http://www.footballguys.com/redzone1.htm , Brookins has gradually been seeing more and more Red Zone touches.   In week 4, he had 8 rushes in the redzone compared to 2 for Allen.   Last week, he had 4 red zone rushes while Terry Allen had zero  (Allen did have a pass thrown to him in the Red Zone). The Cleveland Defense is below average ranking # 22 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks.  They're # 18 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.   Clearly, Brian Billick has confidence in Brookins with the Red Zone touches and that's a trend that's likely to continue. Washington's Stephen Davis vs Carolina Defense If you've been hanging with Stephen Davis all season, you might as well give him another shot here.   The Panthers are weak against the rush ranking # 25 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks.   They rank # 21 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.   The Panthers will be forced to start a banged up Linebacking corps that could be vulnerable.   Davis ran well against the Cowboys totally 99 yards on 23 carries (4.3 ypc) but he needs to get in the endzone.   He might get that chance against Carolina. New York's Tiki Barber / Ron Dayne vs Philadelphia Defense This one is tough to call right now.   Barber did some running this week and is Probable to play.   The game is Monday night though so he's got an extra 30 hours or so to get ready.   Dayne looks to be ready to roll here and he could do some damage against an overrated Eagle rush defense.   They have the good reputation but in reality, they rank # 24 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks.   They rank # 22 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs so it's no fluke.   My best guess on Barber is that he'll play a good bit.   I wouldn't be surprised to see the Giants look almost back to ""normal"" with Dayne and Barber. New England's Antowain Smith vs Indianapolis Defense QB Tom Brady is improving every week and that's helping the running game. This week they'll face one of the softer defenses in the league in Indy. The Colts rank # 26 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks.   Even worse, when it comes to Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs, they rank # 30.   Smith will need all the help he can get.   Last week, he ran for 36 yards on 15 carries (2.4 ypc) against San Diego.   Although the Chargers are tough and he did get a TD.   Remember that Indy is the team that got Smith rolling back in week three where he broke out with 94 yards on 22 carries (4.3 ypc) and 2 TDs.   He's inconsistent but this is a good matchup for Smith. Green Bay's Ahman Green vs Minnesota Defense The fast track of the Metrodome paired with the Viking defense should make for a nice game from Green.   Last week, Green was held to just 54 yards on 20 carries (2.7 ypc).   But that was against Baltimore.   Against a Viking team that yielded 108 yards to James Stewart last week, I think Green will fare even better.   Statistically, the Vikings have been ok ranking # 15 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks and # 15 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.   But this team is struggling. /**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/ Even Matchups:  These games feature no real advantage either way San Diego's LaDainian Tomlinson vs Denver Defense LaDainian Tomlinson enters this week as the # 4 RB over the last 3 weeks. He'll be facing a pretty tough Bronco defense ranked # 11 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks.   They're # 12 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.   Denver is tough between the tackles but Tomlinson has shown he has the speed and skill to break outside when he needs to.   San Diego knows Tomlinson is the key to their success and I expect them to lean heavily upon him. New Orleans' Ricky Williams vs Atlanta Defense Williams is playing as well as any RB in the game right now.   He's running hard and more importantly, he looks like he's having fun.   Don't underestimate that angle for a guy like Ricky Williams.   The Falcon defense is decent ranking # 16 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks.   They're a little tougher in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs where they rank # 11.   I can't see benching him unless you're just totally loaded at RB. Indianapolis' Edgerrin James vs New England Defense Play Edgerrin James.   You don't need me for that.   He rolled up 115 yards on 26 carries (4.5 ypc) against Oakland Sunday night.   New England ranks # 19 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks and # 24 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.   Start James. Detroit's James Stewart vs Tennessee Defense James Stewart rolled last week against a weak Viking defense posting 108 yards on just 16 carries (6.1 ypc)   This week, he'll face a definitely beatable Tennessee defense that ranks # 18 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks.   They're even more vulnerable if you look at Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs where they rank # 27.   QB Charlie Batch played a great game last week and he'll go a long ways toward helping Stewart's numbers although this team does seem more interested in throwing the ball than they do in letting Stewart control the ground game. Buffalo's Travis Henry vs Jacksonville Defense Travis Henry's had a week to rest and get's the national stage to prove himself on Thursday night.   Jacksonville's defense has been up and down this year.   They rank # 20 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks.   LB Hardy Nickerson is still Questionable with his neck injury. If he can't go, that'll surely be a plus for Henry.   Even without Nickerson, they've been pretty tough only allowing 4 TDs in the last 4 games.   I think everyone pretty much agrees Rob Johnson isn't going to carry this team now so look for Coach Gregg Williams to see if Henry can shoulder the load.   Keep an eye on his knee situation as he's had a nagging soreness that the docs are diagnosing as tendonitis.   The word now though is that he'll be able to play through it. Chicago's James Allen / Anthony Thomas vs Cincinnati Defense Another week where it'll be tough to tell who gets the carries.   We keep expecting Thomas to grab more and more time but Allen is hanging on.   Last week Allen rushed 18 times for 75 yards (4.2 ypc) plus a TD.   Thomas had 11 carries for 58 yards (5.3 ypc)   Obviously, both were effective.   Allen is still getting the Red Zone Touches though so it seems pretty clear that coach Dick Jauron has faith in him.   The Bengals rank # 23 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks and # 14 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.   I'd look for a similar distribution of carries between Allen and Thomas this week although I think you'll see more and more of Thomas.   It's murky enough right now, that I don't honestly feel real good about either guy. /**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/ Downside Matchups:  These games feature a Defense that could pose trouble for the Offense. Tampa Bay's Warrick Dunn / Mike Alstott vs Pittsburgh Defense Warrick Dunn made it back onto the field last week when he wasn't expected to.   He did score a TD, but overall, he was totally ineffective rushing for 16 yards on 10 carries (1.6 ypc)   Mike Alstott was even worse running for 4 yards on 5 carries (0.8 ypc)   It's pretty bad when Brad Johnson has the best ypc average on the team...at 2.0 ypc.   This week, they face a tougher defense in Pittsburgh.   The Steelers rank # 8 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks.   They rank # 10 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs. Pittsburgh's Jerome Bettis vs Tampa Bay Defense Here's a troubling thought about Jerome Bettis for this week that was brought up on our message boards www.footballguystalk.com this week. Remember in week 1 when all the talk was about Bettis being limited in Jacksonville because of his asthma and the Florida heat and humidity? Bettis went on to total 28 yards on 12 carries (2.3 ypc) against Jacksonville.  Guess what the weather is predicted to be in Tampa? http://www.footballguys.com/weatherweek6a.htm   84 degrees and humid.   It won't help that Tampa has a solid rush defense ranking # 12 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks.   They're stingier with points ranking # 7 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.   On the upside, Linebackers Derrick Brooks and Jeff Gooch are probably not 100%.   I like Bettis and he's on a roll but this is a tough matchup here. New York Jet's Curtis Martin vs St. Louis Defense Curtis Martin ran exceptionally well against a tough Miami Defense last week posting 120 yards on 22 carries (5.5 ypc)   He's by far the focus of that offense.   Look for more of the same this week against the Rams.   St. Louis is solid against the run ranking # 9 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks.  They seem to give up a lot of points though as they rank # 17 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.   Look for more Martin to again carry the load. Atlanta's Maurice Smith vs New Orleans Defense Smith struggled last week against a good San Francisco rush defense.   He only gained 50 yards on 20 carries (2.5 ypc)   Even worse, 24 of those yards came on one carry.   That means he had just 26 yards on 19 carries for 1.4 ypc.  (Joes Note:  I'm not a fan of taking one big play away and looking at the numbers as I think you can really skew the data that way.   But, it's also something worth keeping in the back of your mind.)   On the plus side, he garnered 20 of the Falcons 24 rushing attempts so he looks to be the man. For an even bigger plus, he scored a rushing TD.   This week, he faces a very tough New Orleans defense that ranks # 3 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks.   They rank # 8 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs for the season.   This may not be the best week to start Smith if you've got other options.   I want to see how he does against this tough defense and to see if Coach Dan Reeves starts using Bob Christian a little more. Cincinnati's Corey Dillon vs Chicago Defense Power vs Power.   The Bears have been playing excellent run defense behind Brian Urlacher, Keith Traylor and Ted Washington.   They rank # 10 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks.   More impressively, they rank # 5 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs for the year. Dillon will be a great test though as they've not faced a RB of his caliber yet.   Last week he rolled for 140 yards on 31 carries (4.5 ypc) and a TD. But the Browns don't bring the same defense that Chicago will.   The key will be Jon Kitna and his passing game keeping the defense honest.   If the safeties are able to walk towards the line, it might be a long day for Dillon.   He's been handled by tough defenses once this year with Baltimore holding him to 57 yards on 18 carries (3.2 ypc)   It should be noted though that the Bears are not yet the Ravens on defense and that Dillon did find the endzone in the Baltimore game with a TD reception.   Not the best matchup for Dillon but one that will be fun to watch. /**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/ Defensive Slam Dunks:  These games feature a very tough Defense posing major problems for the Offense. Philadelphia's Correll Buckhalter / Duce Staley vs New York Giants Defense Duce Staley will likely make his return back from a shoulder injury this week but it's unclear how much he'll play.   Rookie Correll Buckhalter's done a very good job in his absence.   But I think it's pretty clear that it's Duce's job when he's healthy.   I'm not too excited about either player this week against a Giant defense that is shutting down the running game. They rank # 2 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks. They rank # 3 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.   I'd avoid both of these guys this week unless you're really short on options. Minnesota's Doug Chapman / Travis Prentice vs Green Bay Defense Frustrated Michael Bennett owners can at least know for sure how he'll do this week.   He won't play.   Bennett's nursing a bad ankle and Coach Denny Green's named Doug Chapman the starter.   But also look for Travis Prentice to see time as the short yardage / goal line guy.   Considering the Vikings already have one of the best goal line ""backs"" in the league with QB Daunte Culpepper, the situation is even murkier.   Throw in the fact that Green Bay plays very solid rush defense and I'm not real excited about any of the Viking RBs.   The Packers rank # 7 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks.   And they rank # 4 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs. Denver's Mike Anderson vs San Diego Defense Anderson will have his work cut out for him against a tough Charger defense that held New England's Antowain Smith to 36 yards on 15 carries (2.4 ypc) last week.   Anderson and the Broncos are a lot better than Smith and the Patriots but still, it won't be easy.   San Diego ranks # 4 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks and # 2 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.   Anderson was held in check last week against a good Seattle defense rushing for only 51 yards on 17 carries (3.0 ypc)   QB Brian Griese's shoulder is still sore and Anderson will need a healthy Griese to loosen Safety Rodney Harrison who's a run stopper supreme.   Terrell Davis has been making a little noise about possibly playing this week but I don't see it.  It's about to get murky again though.   If you don't feel like dealing with the Shanahan guessing games here soon, you should move Anderson now. Cleveland's James Jackson / Jamel White vs Baltimore Defense Don't go here.   Let's say it this way:   Last week, James Jackson totaled 22 yards on 14 carries for a whopping 1.6 ypc number.   Against Cincinnati. I like the Bengals but they're not Baltimore.   Look elsewhere. Baltimore's streak of not allowing a 100 yard rusher will end sometime.   It won't be this week though. /**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/ That'll do it for the Rushing Matchups.

bryant@cheatsheets.net,0,0,0.89,adfda5ff-6dac-43c5-a3ae-1bb7d9437796,"body: Wheatley to Miss ""About a Month"" Entire story:   http://espn.go.com/nfl/columns/pasquarelli_len/1265229.html Clipped from the Len Pasquarelli article from 10-17: It looks like Oakland Raiders coach Jon Gruden won't have the luxury of playing running back roulette, often rotating between Tyrone Wheatley and Charlie Garner depending on the game situation and formation, for about the next month. Sources told ESPN.com that Wheatley likely will miss three to four weeks with a right knee sprain suffered in Sunday night's road victory at Indianapolis. An examination indicated there is no significant structural damage, but Wheatley will need rest and rehabilitation. Oakland has a bye this week and resumes play Oct. 28 at Philadelphia. Wheatley apparently injured the knee on his third carry of the game, but kept playing. Two fourth-quarter errors, a fumble that led to a Colts touchdown and a dropped pass that forced the Raiders to punt, drew the ire of Gruden. The two had words on the sideline, Wheatley threw his helmet to the bench and did not return. The seventh-year veteran is said to be frustrated not only by the injury, but also by what he feels is diminished playing time, and the perception Gruden regards Garner as a better fit for the Oakland offense. Wheatley started the Sunday night game, but Garner opened the previous two contests, and the players started the first two games of the year in tandem. Although Wheatley has more rushes than Garner (55-53), the latter has more ""touches"" (72-63), because of his abilities as a receiver. The Raiders have used Garner at tailback, slot receiver and wide receiver, and it appears his versatility is well-suited to an offense that utilizes a dizzying assortment of formations and shifts. The absence of Wheatley could further stymie a running game that has lacked the power of a year ago. The Raiders are statistically ranked 19th in rushing after leading the league in 2000. Oakland is averaging just 98.2 rushing yards per game and 3.4 yards per carry. In the first five games last year, the Raiders averaged 123.8 yards per game and 4.1 yards per attempt. Gruden has worked No. 3 tailback Randy Jordan into the lineup in certain situations and said earlier this week he wants to get the versatile Terry Kirby involved as well. Kirby does not have a rushing attempt this season. [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [  OUR VIEW  ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] Clearly, huge news for Garner.   We've been hyping him as the guy who'll see more and more carries and I think that would have happened even without the Wheatley injury.   Garner will obviously benefit from the increased playing time.   Wheatley owners go to the backup plan and you other folks may consider making a move for Garner. More as we hear it.

bryant@cheatsheets.net,0,0,0.889,de4b5d08-0972-4fae-b61a-5623d3f30792,"body: Hi Folks, Footballguy Scott Luebke takes a look at this week's players who are moving up and down in value. IMPORTANT NOTE:  Remember that Dallas, and Oakland are on byes this week in addition to Miami, Seattle and San Francisco.   Dallas and Oakland were originally scheduled to play but moved their game up.   This could affect your team if you had planned on any Cowboys or Raiders filling in for your Miami, Seattle and San Francisco players.   Don't get caught shorthanded and make a pickup if you need to. Also remember the Thursday game this week if your league has special rules for turning in rosters. Have a great week. Joe /**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/ Upgrades QBs Moving Up QB - Jeff Garcia - Garcia looked great on Sunday against the Falcons with 332 passing yards, 70 rushing yards and 4 total touchdowns.  He continues to prove that the 2000 season is no aberration.  As long as Terrell Owens remains healthy, Garcia will continue to produce.  Very impressive on Sunday. QB - Steve McNair - After appearing invisible for the season heading into Sunday, McNair shocked and impressed fantasy owners with 230 yards passing, 54 yards rushing and 2 total touchdowns against a solid Tampa Bay defense. Although he was impressive on Sunday, don't rely on McNair as your fantasy team starter on a weekly basis.  If McNair could get some big play weapons on offense, he could become a top flight fantasy quarterback.  For now, be happy with Sunday's performance. QB - Vinny Testaverde - Testaverde impressed with an efficient performance once again on Sunday.  Testaverde has yet to throw an interception this season.  With 4 touchdowns in the last 2 games, Vinny is looking good.  Keep in mind, Testaverde has yet to surpass the 200 yard barrier, so his value is much higher in basic scoring leagues. RBs Moving Up RB - Ricky Williams - After a slow start to the season, Williams has gained 356 total yards and 2 touchdowns in his last 2 games.  Keep in mind, Williams has already had his bye, so he should be a fixture in your lineup for the remainder of the season as long as he stays healthy. RB - Eddie George - George finally delighted fantasy owners with 132 total yards and a touchdown on Sunday.  The patient owner will start to see the rewards of having George on the roster for the remainder of the season. With George having Miami, Jacksonville, Baltimore, Tampa Bay and a bye week in the first 5 weeks of the season, his schedule was difficult.  The schedule only gets easier for George during the remainder of the season. Look for a strong finish to the season out of George. RB - Priest Holmes - With Tony Richardson out of the lineup, Holmes was given the chance to produce and he has not disappointed.  During his last 3 games, Holmes has averaged 158 total yards and scored 5 touchdowns.  More importantly, Holmes has apparently claimed the feature back role in the Kansas City offense.  Look for Holmes to ride the ""production train"" for the next few weeks with matchups against Arizona and Indianapolis. RB - Warrick Dunn - Expected to be out 4-6 weeks, Dunn returned to the lineup after a 1 week absence and delighted fantasy owners.  Despite having just 16 yards rushing, Dunn added 65 yards receiving and 2 touchdowns.  The early return gives Dunn a tremendous upgrade. RB - Shaun Alexander - Will Ricky Watters have the starting job when he returns from injury?  Probably not.  Alexander finished with 142 rushing yards and 2 touchdowns against Denver.  With Watters in the last year of his contract, look for the Seahawks to keep Alexander in the starting lineup for the remainder of the season.  A great keeper/dynasty running back. RB - Ron Dayne - After being limited in practice by a neck injury suffered in the Washington game, Dayne hit the field and a delighted fantasy owners. With 88 rushing yards and a touchdown on Sunday, Dayne continues to gain momentum into being named the team's feature back.  With Tiki Barber hampered by a hamstring injury, Dayne will be able to post quality numbers against some poor defenses. WRs Moving Up WR - Keyshawn Johnson - Johnson took over the game with 8 catches for 140 yards against Tennessee.  However, he has yet to connect with Brad Johnson for a receiving touchdown this season. WR - Kevin Johnson - Johnson was able to beat a bad Cincinnati secondary for a career high 153 yards receiving on Sunday.  With the continued development of Tim Couch, Johnson could be a quality fantasy option for the remainder of the season.  Keep in mind, Cleveland plays in a tough division where low scoring games will be the norm. WR - Terry Glenn - Once thought to be written off for the entire season, Glenn returned in a big way on Sunday with 110 yards and a touchdown.  If the Patriots offensive line can protect the quarterback, Glenn could have a decent remainder of the season.  Don't expect these type of numbers every week.  Look for Glenn to put up inconsistent numbers the rest of the way. WR - Terrell Owens - 183 receiving yards and 3 touchdowns deserves an upgrade in my book.  Basically, keep him in your lineup every week. WR - Germane Crowell - Crowell finished with 125 yards and a touchdown on Sunday.  Everything looked good with Charlie Batch at the helm for the passing game.  Reality check...this game was against the hapless Vikings secondary.  Regardless, 125 yards and a touchdown deserves the upgrade. TEs Moving Up TE - Cam Cleeland - Despite having just 3 catches for 38 yards on Sunday, Cleeland was able to get into the scoring column with the all important 2 touchdowns.  With opponents fearful of the Saints wide receiving corps of Horn, Jackson and Crowell, Cleeland is seeing plenty of one on one coverage. Cleeland is most likely on a fantasy roster.  If not, go get him. TE - Bubba Franks - 2 reception for 4 yards.  Not that impressive, unless you realize that both catches were touchdowns. Franks has scored 5 touchdowns in the first 5 games this season.  Look for continued success as Franks is a key to success for the Packers in the red zone. TE - Marcus Pollard - The Colts continue to get Pollard involved in the offense.  He has averaged 58 receiving yards in the last 2 games while scoring a touchdown.  However, Pollard ran a couple poor routes that led to two interceptions for Manning. /**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/ Downgrades QBs Moving Down QB - Rob ""The Running Joke"" Johnson - Yep, that's right.  With the help of all the sharks out there, we were able to once again downgrade Rob Johnson, even with him being on a bye week.  After spending a few hours laughing through numerous Rob Johnson takes, I was unable to come to a decision on the best take.  With that said, I will let you, the sharks, decide the best Rob Johnson downgrade take.  Cast your vote on the footballguystalk.com message board.   Buffalo Fans, we feel your pain out there.   I know you guys are some of the best fans in the league, we're just trying to lighten things up.   Here are a few takes from some of our readers: Take #1: I just took the SAT, and actually had this question. I think it sums it up best. Samuel L. Jackson is to Mr. Glass as Rob Johnson is to _______. A) Mr. Styrofoam B) Mr. Balsa Wood C) Mr. Tin Foil D) Mrs. Glass I said D. What do you think, did I get it right? Thanks Jonathon Hoff ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---- Take #2: Rob Johnson took his heaviest blow this past week, injuring not only his neck (pinched nerve), but also his ""best side"". Johnson was quoted as saying ""Sure, the neck hurts, but this bruise on my cheek is really going to affect my promo photos. How's a guy supposed to make a living?"" While Johnson is day-to-day because of the neck, it appears his profile injury will keep him out of the ""pretty business"" for 3-4 weeks. Adding insult to injury, his agent apparently will have Flutie sub for Johnson during this hiatus. The agent responded ""Hey, when Johnson couldn't cut it on the football field last year, Flutie kicked ass, so I suspect he can replace Rob here, too."" We're downgrading the Buffalo QB, and we'd keep Johnson on the bench in fantasy football, and in fantasy modeling. Guy Whitehead ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---- Take #3: Top 5 Reasons to downgrade Rob Johnson: 5. Silly headband brings back painful 80s memories 4. Deceased blues legend Robert Johnson is a more viable fantasy option 3. Janet Reno considers ordering agents to take Doug Flutie by force and return him to his rightful home in Buffalo. Johnson might be sent to Cuba to live with Elian Gonzalez. Castro to protest before United Nations and demand Alex Van Pelt instead. 2. Sneaky agent includes bonus clause for appearing on injury report. 1. Jerry Jones praises Johnson as his ""next big find"". Regards, MKF Seriously Now, Another QB Moving Down QB - Trent Green - Green continues to disappoint fantasy owners.  With the nagging injuries to Derrick Alexander and Marvin Minnis being inexperienced, Green continues to have problems finding his wide receivers.  Prior to the season, there was speculation that the loss of Sylvester Morris would hurt Green's production.  The speculation was correct. RBs Moving Down RB - Ricky Watters - The emergence of Shaun Alexander downgrades the injured Watters' value further. RB - Marshall Faulk -   Faulk suffered a sprained MCL on Sunday.  Initial indications speculated that Faulk would miss 4 weeks of action.  The next reports had Faulk missing 1-2 games.   Now they're saying he could play this week!   Regardless, make sure you grab Trung Canidate, if you are a Faulk owner.   It'll help you sleep better. RB - Tyrone Wheatley - Despite getting the carry at the goal line and a short score, Wheatley gets the downgrade this week.  With just 7 carries for 24 yards and a fumble, it appears the Raiders are leaning towards making Charlie Garner the feature back.  More importantly, Wheatley missed a key pass block that led to a hard hit on Rich Gannon.  Basically, it appeared that Wheatley shied away from contact on the play and did his best bullfighter imitation.  Jon Gruden did not appear very happy. RB - Mike Alstott - 5 carries for 4 yards...OUCH! RB - Michael Bennett - Bennett was able to manage 13 carries on Sunday. However, he finished with just 46 rushing yards and no touchdowns.  Plus, Bennett suffered a sprained right ankle that forced him out of the game. Keep him on your bench for the time being. WRs Moving Down WR - Bill Schroeder - Schroeder suffered a sprained ankle in Sunday's game versus Baltimore.  The injury does not appear to be serious, but something worth watching.  Because of the injury, Schroeder is downgraded this week. WR - Derrick Alexander - Plain and simple, Alexander has done nothing this season and is among the biggest disappointments of the fantasy season. Alexander earns a spot on the ""Biggest Disappointment Team"". WR - Willie Jackson - Although I am still high on Willie Jackson, he was held to just 25 yards on 2 catches this weekend.  Every receiver will have bad outings throughout the course of the year so this might be a little harsh placing him here.   But it's a murky situation how the distribution will play out in New Orleans.   QB Aaron Brooks needs to get it going. WR - Wayne Chrebet - Chrebet has failed to score on the year and seems to have taken a back seat to Laveranues Coles in the Jets wide receiving crew. There's a chance Chrebet's numbers could increase as team's start focusing their attention on the speedy Coles but for now, we're a little worried about Chrebet. /**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/ Waiver Wire QB - Charlie Batch - During comeback mode against the Vikings, Batch managed to gain 345 yards and pass for 3 touchdowns.  Don't get too high on Batch yet.  Remember, this performance came against a mediocre Vikings secondary. However, Johnnie Morton and Germane Crowell provide Batch with two quality receivers.  Look for more good games out of Batch...against weaker defenses. QB - Tom Brady - With the addition of Terry Glenn in the lineup, Brady torched the San Diego defense throughout the game.  Don't expect these kind of numbers on a weekly basis, but there are signs that Brady has the potential to become a good fantasy quarterback, although you have to consider Bledsoe and what happens when he's ready to go.   Regardless, Brady is a decent option for fantasy owners in need of a quarterback right now. RB - Trung Canidate - Canidate will probably get at least start as the running back for the powerful Rams offense.  Marshall Faulk was expected to miss at least 4 weeks during initial reports.  The the next reports have Faulk missing 1-2 weeks of action.   Now they're saying he could play this week.   He's still not a bad guy to have for insurance. RB - Anthony Thomas - Thomas continues to get a good number of carries.  It is becoming more apparent that the Bears are slowly giving the feature back role to Thomas.  Look for Thomas' role to become larger and larger as the season progresses. WR - Terry Glenn - Once thought to be written off for the entire season, Glenn returned in a big way on Sunday with 110 yards and a touchdown.  If the Patriots offensive line can protect the quarterback, Glenn could have a decent remainder of the season.  Don't expect these type of numbers every week, but Glenn could be a welcome addition to a fantasy team in need of a receiver. WR - Donald Hayes - With defenses rolling coverage in the direction of the talented Muhsin Muhammad, Donald Hayes is seeing a lot of one-on-one coverage.  With 7 catches and a touchdown on Sunday, it appears that Chris Weinke and Hayes are starting to build a quality QB to WR relationship. WR - Eddie Kennison - Kennison showed signs of quality production this week. With Rod Smith seeing double/triple coverage on the other side of the field, Kennison will be given a great chance to post excellent fantasy numbers. Kennison is an extremely talented receiver and maybe this week's performance was needed to get him ""over the hump"". Check back next week for The General's All-Disappointment Team. /**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/ Bryant Analytics, Inc.

bryant@cheatsheets.net,0,0,0.884,5e6674b1-a5db-4ba5-bfde-a86a0d287725,"body: Hi Folks, Lots of email pouring in on these guys so I wanted to share the latest here: Griese ""Questionable"" But Should Start Entire Story:   http://espn.go.com/nfl/news/2001/1012/1263238.html DENVER -- After missing most of Thursday's practice with a sore throwing shoulder, Denver Broncos quarterback Brian Griese was a full participant in Friday's workout and was expected to start on Sunday in Seattle. The Broncos added Griese to their injury report on Friday morning, listing him as questionable. An hour later, however, Griese had no obvious discomfort during a 75-minute workout. Coach Mike Shanahan said he was confident that, barring any setbacks, Griese will play against the Seahawks. Griese has had surgery twice on his shoulder, after the 1999 and 2000 seasons. Shanahan said Griese reported soreness in his shoulder after Sunday's 20-6 win over Kansas City. The injury likely occurred in the first half, since Griese threw only five passes after intermission. For the game, he was 11-of-20 for 121 yards with one touchdown and one interception. ""It was sore after the game, but we didn't think it was anything that would keep him from playing,"" Shanahan said Friday. ""He couldn't practice (Thursday). He just took a few reps and it was sore. That's why we put him on the questionable list. I wasn't really sure where we'd be at (Friday). ""But he was able to make it through practice and he was effective. So if there's no setback, then he'll be able to go Sunday."" If Griese had been unable to practice Friday, Shanahan said, the Broncos would have prepared backup Gus Frerotte for a starting role. ""If you don't practice Thursday and Friday, then you don't start,"" Shanahan said. ""But he was able to go through the whole practice, and he practiced well."" [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [  OUR VIEW  ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] Scary news to see him listed but sounds like good news that he'll play. Gotta love Shanahan making a mockery of the ""Questionable"" listing saying he's confident Griese will play.   As we've been telling you since May, you should back up your valuable skill guys in great situations with their real backup.   It was a lot better before Ed McCaffrey's injury but Griese would probably qualify as one of those guys in great situations.   If you (or your arch rival) own Griese, it's a good idea that you grab Frerotte if you haven't already. /**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/ Derrick Alexander Improving From an interview with Dick Vermeil today on KCChiefs.com Question: Did (WR) Derrick Alexander take a full day of reps? VERMEIL: ""Not the full amount but he did work. I asked him after practice how he felt and he said he felt good. I don't know how long it's been since he's said he felt good."" ESPN.com is also reporting on their Injuries page that Alexander will be able to play this week. (although I take that page with a grain of salt) [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [  OUR VIEW  ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] It's a risky play here.   We'd told you this week that it wasn't looking good for Alexander's back.   He seems to be over the Achilles trouble but the back was so stiff earlier this week he couldn't tie his shoes.   That appears to be getting better.   Still though, he's a large risk.   I would still shy away unless I didn't have any alternatives close to him.   A sore back is the kind of thing that could tighten up at any time and it's just too risky in my opinion. /**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/ More as we hear it.

bryant@cheatsheets.net,0,0,0.895,d925facb-72aa-48c7-a00e-d468955b3ac1,"body: Hi Folks, St. Louis News and Notes from our Buddy and Footballguy Bob Harris of the award winning www.TFLReport.com FAULK WON'T PLAY AGAINST JETS TOMORROW... Posted Saturday October 20, 2001 @ 17:35 PT In a message posted on his online forum at the St. Louis Post-Dispatch web site, columnist Bernie Miklasz stated that Rams running back Marshall Faulk won't play against the New York Jets tomorrow, a development head coach Mike Martz all but announced Friday evening when told reporters he was ""pessimistic"" about Faulk's chances of hitting the field this weekend. Faulk, who refused to talk to the media Friday, was listed as questionable on the official midweek injury report after bruising his right knee last weekend against the Giants. He sat out of practice all week but worked out on a treadmill. He appeared to be pain free, walking without a limp. On Friday, the knee was not wrapped. But Martz said at the time, ""The thing with a bone bruise is (if) you play, it sets you back. It's a temptation that's hard to fight because he wants to play. In his mind he should play, but we're trying to do the right thing with this and make sure that we've got him for the rest of the season."" The coach went on to say he was confident in Trung Canidate's ability to get the job done in Faulk's absence. Quarterback Kurt Warner, who has never played in a game for the Rams without Faulk lined up behind him, agreed with that assessment. ""Trung has played well when he has played. He has never been in a position where he has to carry the load. Now it is all on him. Trung is going to be fine. He knows the system and he is a good football player. Now he's going to get a chance to shine a little bit. We all have confidence in him that he is going to do a great job."" Warner also pointed out that the already blazing fast St. Louis offense becomes even faster with Canidate in the mix. ""Trung is so explosive with his speed that if you give that guy a crack he can take it against anybody,"" the former Arena League star explained. ""We have seen him cut back and make some huge plays already this year. Trung has an extra gear and he brings that speed to the equation. We are going to have to get him up to speed with the route running part of it, and those are the kinds of things that he will have to iron out to get to the same level so that we can do everything that we do with Marshall with him."" While Canidate is clearly expected to handle the bulk of the workload, Robert Holcombe is likely to get a carry or two also. ... Other notes of interest. ... According to SportsLine.com senior writer Pete Prisco, when you ask most NFL players to assess their backup, you generally get a positive response -- often in the form of an eloquent or enthusiastic vote of confidence that casts the backup in question in the best possible light. However, that wasn't the case when Faulk was asked about Canidate last Sunday. Prisco wrote at the time, ""Faulk clearly did not want to discuss his replacement. In fairness, it was only an hour or so after he injured his knee against the Giants, but even so, what would it have hurt to prop the kid up?"" Asked what fans could expect from Canidate, the former Colts said, ""I don't know. You'll have to ask Mike Martz. He hasn't played. I don't know. I haven't watched him play. I saw him play in the preseason.'' Asked if he'd be willing to guess what the former University of Arizona star might be capable of, Faulk shot back with ""Your guess is as good as mine.'' Faulk's behavior prompted Prisco to openly wonder whether the best running back in the league felt threatened by Canidate's youthful speed or whether he simply doesn't like the kid. .. Whatever his reason was, Faulk clearly had no interest in propping up the guy in the locker next to his. And finally. ... Warner, who was knocked out of the game for a play by Giants defensive end Michael Strahan, said he was fine on Thursday. ""To tell you the truth I feel great,"" the veteran signal caller said. ""Other than where I got hit when I got the wind knocked out of me. My back is a little bit sore and my ribs. Other than that I feel great. I was a little sore on Monday but I feel good today."" ---------- (c) 2001 FSP, Inc. & The TFL Report.

bryant@cheatsheets.net,0,0,0.894,95f5a548-8982-43e1-bac0-e58b557eab14,"body: Travis Henry to Face Possible Sex Charges Entire story:   http://www.buffalonews.com/editorial/20011019/1047714.asp Clipped from the Bucky Gleason article: Buffalo Bills running back Travis Henry faces criminal charges that are expected to be lodged next week in connection with a sex-related incident involving a 15-year-old girl in his home, law enforcement officials said. The officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Thursday that Henry likely would be offered a plea arrangement that would allow him to avoid a statutory rape charge in exchange for a guilty plea to a yet-to-be-determined misdemeanor charge. Charges could be filed as early as Monday or Tuesday, officials said. ""I've just become involved,"" said Henry's attorney, Terrence M. Connors. ""I'm talking to Travis and trying to find out the underlying facts and exploring all the options."" Investigators have been looking into the incident since Sept. 23, when two girls escaped from Hopevale Union Free School, a detention home for girls in Hamburg. Investigators said Henry, 22, had returned with the Bills from their game in Indianapolis and met the girls, 15 and 14, during a chance encounter at a Camp Road gas station. The three went to watch television at Henry's house, where the sexual encounter is alleged to have taken place with one of the girls, who apparently told Henry she was 18. Sources said Henry acknowledged having sex with the girl but said he didn't know she was a juvenile. Henry had not been charged as of Thursday. The rookie was in Jacksonville for the Bills' game against the Jaguars. Hamburg Police Chief Joseph Coggins would say only that the case was under investigation. Erie County District Attorney Frank J. Clark would not comment on the case. A person who is older than 21 can be charged with statutory rape for having sexual intercourse with someone younger than 17, regardless of consent. However, authorities generally treat cases differently when one person is in the early 20s and the other is in the midteens. Sources said prosecutors might be willing to give Henry leniency because the girl admitted lying about her age and said she was not forced into having sex, and because Henry has no prior criminal record. The Bills have been aware of the inquiry for more than a week. President and General Manager Tom Donahoe would not comment on the case. ""Until there's something that officially comes out, I can't respond,"" Donahoe said from Jacksonville. [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [  OUR VIEW  ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] Let's see how this plays out.   As the article says, it's likely this would have the end result of a misdemeanor charge.   Still troubling though. More as we hear it. Joe /**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/ Bryant Analytics, Inc.

Foxboro, MA (Sports Network) - Patriots wide receiver Terry Glenn injured his hamstring during a workout on Thursday, and may not suit up for Sunday's game against the Colts. Midway through the Patriots' afternoon session, Glenn came up hobbling after making a cut on a pass route. The extent of his injury is not known. Glenn also experienced soreness after the team's 29-26 overtime win over the Chargers last week. Yet, he may have aggravated the injury on Thursday, possibly resulting in a pull or tear. The six-year Ohio State product caught seven passes for 110 yards with a touchdown in his first game back since being suspended on August 3 for violating the league's substance abuse policy.

Now that the cold weather is on its way (there were actually some snow flakes up north) I'm starting to remember how it was last Winter.  Wherever I decide to go, it's going to be somewhere WARM.  Sunny days, warm nights, moonlight walks, good times. With prices so low, it's the perfect time to make your vacation plans.  See the sun, have some excitement, travel with your family and friends.

Basically, I started off with your proposed procedures  and made a few changes that Enron needs to make sure that right amount of gas shows up  at the correct time. Also, we are suggesting a confirmation form be sent back and forth between  Enron and Sithe every day.  This will help document all the small little details and  costs so that we both drop anything through the cracks.  I am suggesting that we e-mail this  confirm form to the right folks in both our companies, so that no one is left out of the  loop. You will also notice our attempt to make sure that everyone has a clear  understanding of exactly what is included in the numbers that are reported to Enron's  traders.  The timing of your calls will be when everyone is very busy in our trading group.

EnTelligence training now available! Date: Tuesday, Dec 12 Time: 3:00 and 4:00 Location: EB 572 Please stop by to learn more about the system or just get a demo of what it  can do for you!!! Overview EnTelligence is a web-based prospecting tool designed to deliver market  information on existing and potential customers to commercial trading,  mid-marketing, and origination teams.  It also delivers management reports to  analyze Enron,s position within the key industries that we serve.  Presently,  commercial groups have multiple methods for acquiring potential customer  information.  This system will standardize their resource tools and add  consistency to their prospecting processes.  EnTelligence combines  information from internal databases such as Global Counterparty, Credit  Aggregation System (CAS), Sitara, and ERMS with information from external  data sources such as Dun & Bradstreet and I.H.S Energy Reporter to identify  customer prospects.  By providing the capability to filter and search by  region, industry, company size, or energy consumption levels, the prospecting  process is shortened and the identification of strong prospects improved.  Available reports include Market Penetration, Industry Prospecting,  Comparison Prospecting, Company Profiles, Family Tree, Top Customers, and  Inactive Accounts.  Soon to come is the Activity Details report in mid  January.  Currently only Natural Gas and Power physical deals are loaded, but  financial deals will be included in mid January, and new products are soon to  follow.

While numerous factors have  contributed to the high cost of power incurred by California's utilities, the  root cause of the current crisis is a lack of new generation. The current  credit crisis and its threat to supplies could spark state action to address  the situation. The collective efforts of all market participants should be  focused on increasing generation capacity as quickly as possible. Western power prices have skyrocketed well beyond the record levels set this  summer. Perhaps because frozen rates insulate the majority of California  consumers and companies from tangible effects of the market crisis,  regulators have been able to postpone meaningful market reforms and  significant rate increases. The California Public Utilities Commission denied  the requests of Pacific Gas & Electric and Southern California Edison to end  their rate freezes, forcing these utilities at least temporarily to finance  the costs of higher wholesale energy. This has created an unsustainable  accumulation of costs and a loss of faith in the California market.  The current credit crisis and the potential for blackouts may become the  galvanizing events that provide state regulators with a public mandate to  address the underlying structural problems in the industry. However, there is  no guarantee that these regulatory actions will expedite an effective  solution for customers and the industry as a whole. Wholesale and retail  markets that emerge from regulatory intervention are likely to remain  muddled. In the necessarily political process that will follow, it is  possible that-as has largely been the case so far-the steps taken will fail  to move the California power market toward a more enduring solution and will  instead continue to mask the underlying structural flaws.  In the six months since California's supply shortfall began plaguing Western  markets, regulators have done little to address the underlying problem.  Rather than addressing the cause of the supply shortage-establishing a market  environment that encourages timely additions of new generating capacity and  demand side responses-efforts are instead directed at trying to lay blame for  the crisis and lessen the immediate financial impact on customers. Indeed,  several actions taken thus far have served more to compound the problem by  discouraging new power plant additions. These include price caps, repeated  changes to market rules, attempts to seize generator profits, and a  challenging siting and permitting process. Medicine Worse than the Illness  Several years of electricity demand growth and low prices in California were  accompanied by very few additions to the supply base. Regulators did not pay  adequate attention to the looming supply shortfall. The void of consensus  over the cause of the current crisis has instead been replaced by a series of  bandaid remedies that address the symptoms, but not the cause, of  California's electric market woes.*  * Challenging siting and permitting. Despite state action to better  coordinate the siting and permitting process for new power plants, power  plant developers still face high hurdles. Local community opposition alone  has struck down some key proposed facilities. * Price caps discourage investment. State and federal proposals to cap prices  limit the attractiveness of the California wholesale power market, especially  for developers who have the option of channeling scarce capital and equipment  to more stable or more attractive markets outside the state.  * Repeated rule changes. Frequent rule changes in the ISO markets (including  the price caps) confound attempts by developers to estimate profits from new  plant development. * Calls for refunds. Despite reports by the Power Exchange, the ISO, and the  FERC that no pattern of abuse could be found from their examination of the  California markets, state officials continue to accuse power providers of  gaming the market. Calls by state officials for refunds of generator profits  are a threat to new plant development. * Facility inspections. Recent inspections of power plants by state officials  to verify that operators are honestly reporting the operational status of  their generating units accentuates the atmosphere of mistrust. CERA's recent analysis suggests that merchant plant developers in the West  are not guaranteed? to make a profit. Prospects of new plant profitability  are affected by the timing and quantity of new plants, decommissioning of  older units, demand growth, and numerous other difficult-to-forecast factors.  California's regulatory actions only further cloud the assessment of  financial viability and degrade the political environment for developers  considering entering the state.  Despite efforts by the California ISO to stimulate new capacity additions in  the state with a special, limited-term capacity payment, CERA estimates that  demand growth will continue to outstrip supply additions in the West in 2001.  In addition, the existing siting and permitting process will prevent a  sufficient quantity of capacity from entering the market until 2003 at the  earliest. Therefore, three years remain before a sufficient quantity of  capacity enters service to significantly dampen prices and decrease the risk  of an outage.  The Road to Recovery  There are a number of actions that can be taken to help relieve the capacity  shortfall:  * Encourage new build. Supply must be part of the answer. This requires a  series of steps that can help facilitate new supply build. While in principal  some have been taken, such as new fast track approval, the success of these  actions can only be measured by the build itself. For now, there is still not  enough new supply coming on until 2003 to relieve supply tightness.?  * Stabilize investment climate. Utilities must have assurance that they will  ultimately be allowed to recover market costs for power. This provides the  credit worthiness needed by sellers to produce energy and to stimulate new  build. * Move toward more balanced utility supply portfolios. One of the reasons the  pressure on customers has been so intense in California has been the absence  (and even discouragement) of diverse supply portfolios among the utilities in  the state-particularly for residential and small commercial customers. With  the market at a peak, however, now is in one sense a sub-optimal time to move  toward term contracting. Yet these contracts provide the foundation for a  series of actions-including new supply build and demand side investments. If  they end up above market, they will at least have achieved the desired effect  of knocking down prices, a fact which by itself should provide sufficient  justification for recovering the cost of these commitments. * Encourage market mechanisms that elicit a demand response. Although  originally a feature of California's market design, most consumers are  insulated from price spikes through capped or frozen retail rates. Exposing  customers to at least some of the market price signals would encourage a  demand response. * Encourage market mechanisms that dampen the ""Boom Bust"" characteristic of  the market. Whether in the form of a capacity payment, a reserve requirement,  or a minimum term portfolio requirement, the California power market needs to  move to a structure that encourages investment in new capacity when the  market is in balance rather than waiting for a shortage and price shock to  elicit new investment. Such a structure can help dampen (but not eliminate)  future price volatility. * Avoid continuously tinkering with the market. While the market does need to  be restructured as described above, it also needs to be stable and reliable  to encourage the development of new supply as well as a robust long-term  contractual market for power in California. Continually tinkering with the  market structure-such as the three times the price cap has been shifted since  July-only serves to undermine confidence in the market. California needs to  do its best to develop a long-term solution and then let the market run its  course.  * Allow for greater environmental flexibility. The state should explore a  more balanced solution to emissions restrictions in the face of a supply  shortfall that has been exacerbated by generators that cannot operate due to  emissions restrictions.  * Free PURPA power plants to generate. Relief should be granted to PURPA  power plants that are operational, but are restricted by contract from  operating to generate only power.  **end**  This CERA Alert will be available in PDF format within 24 hours.  **********************************************************************  This electronic message and attachments, if any, contain information  from Cambridge Energy Research Associates, Inc.

The data includes max temp, max temp deviation from normal (ie if max is 88  and normal max is 86 max temp deviation is +2), min temp, min temp deviation  from normal and percent of precipitation.  So far things are looking good.   We are getting a cold front this weekend (hitting Texas on Monday) and looks  like things should be beautiful for next weekend.  I wouldn't be that worried  about the rain either - the reason the POP is so high right now is tropical  moisture in the Gulf of Mexico and that will blow through this weekend.   After that the tropics settle down and it is much less likely to get  tropical  moisture.

I  looked and some of your funds haven't done so well this year especially Low  Priced Stock.

The remaining balance is something like $2,500.  All of that amount is allocated to our monthly savings for property/school taxes.  I guess what you're saying is you would like to borrow from this savings account to make this investment.  As long as you feel confident that we will be able to reimburse that amount somehow to pay our taxes (should we not get a return on the investment), then I guess we should go for it if it's something you're excited about and believe is a good investment. Naturally, I would prefer we only invest $500 because of the risk involved and Christmas just around the corner, but you're the one with the financial instincts and know-how.

Hey how much of the money in our Waterhouse account is budgeted for expenses.  I am thinking that it would be a good investment (speculative in nature though) to purchase some options on Enron.  The options would expire in January and the potential return could vary between a loss of 100% of the investment to a 400%-500% return.

no.address@enron.com,0,0,0.902,3be94056-8933-4580-ad88-f8a77f67146e,"body: As you know, Enron Net Works (ENW) and Enron Global Strategic Sourcing (GSS) recently executed a two-year agreement, whereby MCI WorldCom would serve as Enron's primary telecommunications provider.  In our previous communication, we indicated that we would provide you with more detailed information as it became available. Beginning Friday, October 26, 2001 at 9 a.m. C.S.T, the procedure for calling Enron's Houston offices from international locations, excluding Canada, using the 800-97-Enron phone number will change.  The new procedure is as follows:  1.	Please dial the WorldPhone International Access number for the country where you are located (country access code), which is available on the attached wallet card, accessible through the following link:  http://home.enron.com:84/messaging/mciannouncement.doc.     2.	You will then be prompted for your PIN number.  Since calling cards and pin numbers are not required to use this service, all users should respond by dialing 1-800-97-ENRON or 1-800-973-6766.  3.	You will then be asked to enter your destination.  Please dial 0-800-97-Enron (800-973-6766) to reach Enron's corporate offices in Houston.    This procedure can only be used to call 800-97-Enron from WorldPhone International locations.  If you are calling from the U. S. or Canada, please continue to dial 1-800-97-ENRON.    If you have questions regarding commercial aspects of this agreement, please feel free to contact Tom Moore, GSS senior contract manager at 713-345-5552.  For technical issues, please contact Hasan Imam, ENW IT manager at 713-345-8525.      subject: Enron Net Works and Enron Global Strategic Sourcing announce new procedure for using 800-97-Enron telephone number "

PLEASE NOTE:   See the cheatsheets online at www.footballguys.com  for exactly where I rank players and to determine who to start.   I always receive emails asking me how I can have a guy ranked highly on the cheatsheet but listed under a matchup that favors the Defense.   Just because one matchup may be more favorable than another, that doesn't necessarily mean I'd start the player with the best matchup.   Jeff Garcia may have a horrible matchup one week but unless you're sitting on Kurt Warner or Brett Favre, Garcia's your guy no matter who he's lining up against.   The matchup info is meant to be just one more tool in your box when it comes to deciding between players. Note:  I've used the player stats sorted by performance over the last four weeks extensively in developing these write-ups.

Joe /**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/ Passing Game Matchups to Avoid and Exploit /**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/ Locks:  These games feature Defenses that have struggled lately. Cincinnati Passing Game vs Tennessee Defense What a fitting way to wind down the season Sunday as Jon Kitna and Kordell Stewart combined for 662 passing yards and 5 TDs.Kitna had 411 of those yards.   Wow.   When you throw it 68 times, most every receiver will be involved and that's what happened Sunday.   Peter Warrick was very active - maybe the benching helped in week 15.   The Titans rank # 31 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks so this is enticing although you have to wonder if Kitna can do it again.   For the year, Tennessee ranks # 29 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 31 Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs. Check the cheatsheets to see where we rank these guys but clearly, it's a good matchup. Denver Passing Game vs Indianapolis Defense Griese only put up 142 yards passing Sunday but it was enough.   Expect him to do better this week.   Rod Smith is of course, the man here and he'll do well too.   The Colts rank # 30 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 27 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 27 Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs. Indianapolis Passing Game vs Denver Defense Manning came up small in the yardage department with under 200 yards Sunday but he did run in one score.   Marvin Harrison is of course the clear cut go to guy.   Manning's a competitor and you'd have to think he'll give a great effort in the final week with nothing but pride to play for.   The Broncos rank # 27 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 9 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 25 Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs. St. Louis Passing Game vs Atlanta Defense Mike Martz showed last week he'll let his guys play.   Regardless of the playoff situation, I think you'll see Warner in for at least a half and maybe much more.   And like Marshall Faulk, a half of Warner is better than a full game from most other players.   Picking the WR is a lottery shot as Holt, Bruce, Proehl, or Hakim are all liable to go off.   The Falcons rank # 26 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 30 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 30 Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs. /**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/ Prime Matchups:  These games feature Defenses that haven't been strong lately. Carolina Passing Game vs New England Defense Can't imagine you're in week 17 with many Carolina guys on the roster. Weinke did ok last week.   It's tough when you're upset about Isaac Byrd possibly missing time but that's where they are.   Both he and Muhsin Muhammad could miss the last game.   The Patriots rank # 28 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks so they're definitely vulnerable. For the year, they rank # 22 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 20 Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.   It's a good matchup simply because New England hasn 't been much on defense.   I have little faith in the Carolina players to take advantage of the matchup though. Chicago's Passing Game vs Jacksonville Defense When you think it's going to be all Anthony Thomas, Jim Miller and the passing game decided to show off.   Miller put up 252 yards and 2 TDs as the Bears continued to roll.   Marty Booker continues to see lots more passes than any other Bear although David Terrell seems to make the most of what he 's thrown.   The Jaguars rank # 10 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 19 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 6 Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs. Dallas Passing Game vs Detroit Defense Quincy Morgan showed some very nice flashes Sunday hitting Joey Galloway deep.   Galloway seems to be the WR of choice.   He's worth a gamble for sure.   The Lions rank # 25 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 31 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 29 Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs so it's a nice matchup.   It all depends on whether these guys have the talent to take advantage of it.   One more thing, the Cowboys will be doing all they can to get Emmitt Smith his 1,000 yard season so that may be a factor. Kansas City Passing Game vs Seattle Defense Trent Green quietly carried some FF teams Sunday with 2 TDs and 294 yards. Tony Gonzalez finally put together a game like we've been expecting.   He saw 3 times as many passes as the WRs.   Maybe that'll continue this week. The Seahawks rank # 24 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 23 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 16 Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs. Miami Passing Game vs Buffalo Defense Jay Fiedler posted a couple of TDs with his 191 yards which isn't bad. Chris Chambers, Jed Weaver and Oronde Gadsden all saw time but RB Travis Minor seemed to be the primary receiver with 7 catches.   Look for him to be used more as Lamar Smith struggles.   The Bills rank # 29 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 24 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 19 Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs. New England Passing Game vs Carolina Defense Tom Brady's had a week to get ready for the Carolina defense.   Two teams going drastically different directions here.   Terry Glenn could continue to make an impact and you know Troy Brown's ready.   The Panthers rank # 20 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 28 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 22 Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs. Seattle Passing Game vs Kansas City Defense Hindsight is 20/20 but if Trent Dilfer isn't the most under appreciated player in the NFL, I dunno who is.   He's won a jillion games including a Superbowl lately and all he did Sunday was throw 3 TDs and save the Seahawks season (at least for another week)   The big question is will he get another shot?   Hasselbeck is saying he wants to play.  Stay tuned.   Darrell Jackson went nuts last week and if Dilfer gets the nod, you have to look hard at him.   The Chiefs rank # 18 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 15 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 12 Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs. San Francisco Passing Game vs New Orleans Defense Jeff Garcia threw for 229 and 2 TDs against a tough Cowboy pass Defense last week.   Plus he rushed for another TD.   Terrell Owens is a must start. J.J. Stokes is seeing lots of action and TE Eric Johnson is very involved. The Saints defense ranks # 13 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 26 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 23 Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs. /**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/ Even Matchups:  These games feature no real advantage either way Baltimore Passing Game vs Minnesota Defense Elvis Grbac had Raven fans wondering about Trent Dilfer again last week with 205 yards and 2 Interceptions to go with his TD.   The usual suspects of Qadry Ismail, Shannon Sharpe and Travis Taylor will all be active.   The Vikings rank # 19 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks. For the year, they rank # 20 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 24 Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs. Green Bay Passing Game vs New York Giants Defense Favre came up small last week with just 169 yards and 0 TDs.   Granted, it was really cold, but that hasn't seemed to bother him much in the past. Freeman and Schroeder got most of the looks as usual.   TE Bubba Franks saw a handful thrown his way.   They'll face the banged Giant secondary this week ranked # 14 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks. For the year, they rank # 18 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 28 Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs. New Orleans Passing Game vs San Francisco Defense Aaron Brooks took a step back this week with 3 Interceptions vs 1 TD and just 127 yards.   It's not good when Deuce McAllister is the leading receiver but that's what happened Sunday.   Joe Horn and Willie Jackson came up small.   This week, they'll face a 49er defense that's ranked # 16 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 13 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 17 Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs. Pittsburgh Passing Game vs Cleveland Defense Stewart threw for 251 yards and 3 TDs Sunday although he did have 4 Interceptions.   Plaxico Burress is clearly the big play threat and is showing shades of becoming a dominant WR.   Hines Ward is solid as well. The Browns rank # 9 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks. For the year, they rank # 3 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 14 Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs. Tennessee Passing Game vs Cincinnati Defense Steve McNair continues to play well with 274 yards and 2 TDs.   He's a totally different QB when he throws the deep ball.   Although Eddie George's re-emergence may quiet that a bit.   Dyson and Mason both saw an equal number of passes and both scored.   This week, they'll face a Bengal defense ranked # 12 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 16 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 21 Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs. Washington Passing Game vs Arizona Defense Tony Banks put up a whopping 94 yards passing last week.   But part of it was the big lead Washington was able to post.   Westbrook left with an ankle injury so Gardner and TE Zeron Flemister caught what was thrown.   This week, they'll face a Cardinal defense that's been pretty good lately ranking # 7 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 25 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 26 Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs. /**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/ Downside Matchups:  These games feature a Defense that's been pretty strong lately. Atlanta Passing Game vs St. Louis Defense Mike Vick could see the start even if Chandler is ok.   The team is clearly looking at 2002.   He's a dice roll if he starts but it's not like Chandler was consistent.   Vick will likely spread the ball around to Terance Mathis, Shawn Jefferson and Brian Finneran but it's tough to count on this team. The Rams rank # 22 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks. For the year, they rank # 14 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 8 Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs. Cleveland Passing Game vs Pittsburgh Defense For the 2nd week in a row, Couch exploited a great matchup and lit up Tennessee for 336 yards and 3 TDs.   Kevin Johnson was clearly the WR of choice again.   This week, they'll face a Steeler defense that ranks # 15 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 7 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 7 Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs. Jacksonville Passing Game vs Chicago Defense Mark Brunell put together another gritty day with 283 yards and a TD Sunday. Keenan McCardell and Jimmy Smith continue to be one of the toughest WR duos in the league.   They'll face a Bear defense this week ranked # 17 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks.   Clearly, the stats don't quite back up their rep lately.   For the year, they rank # 8 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 2 Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs so they've been stingy allowing FF points. Minnesota Passing Game vs Baltimore Defense Spergon Wynn could well be an NFL QB someday but today isn't that day. Really puts the Cris Carter / Randy Moss owners in a bind.  Normally, they' re sure starts but now I'm not so certain.   He really looked bad at times. Both these receivers are guys who can make up for deficiencies at QB so I still think you'll have to look hard there.   Plus, it's on Monday night so even though the Vikes have pretty much packed it in, they'll probably put forth a good effort.   The Ravens rank # 5 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 17 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 18 Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs. New York Giants Passing Game vs Green Bay Defense Kerry Collins went over 300 yards last week and that was something.   Tiki Barber is still the most frequent target with Toomer and Hilliard seeing pretty much equal attention.   The Packers rank # 3 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks.  For the year, they rank # 12 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 5 Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs. New York Jets Passing Game vs Oakland Defense Vinny Testeverde looked pretty old in the loss to Buffalo with 0 TDs and 2 Interceptions.   Chrebet and Coles are decent options but this team is all about Curtis Martin.   Especially with the Oakland Corners.   The Raiders rank # 8 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 10 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 13 Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs. Oakland Passing Game vs New York Jets Defense Rich Gannon had an excellent day with 313 yards and 2 TDs although he did have the 2 Interceptions.   Jerry Rice and Tim Brown continue to play well and Charlie Garner does a nice job catching the ball.   The Jets are in a must win situation and rank # 11 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 1 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 4 Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs so they've been tough. Philadelphia Passing Game vs Tampa Bay Defense Donovan McNabb started looking for receivers not named Duce Staley last week and better things seemed to happen.   He threw for 3 TDs and nearly 300 yards.   James Thrash saw most of the passes while TE Chad Lewis burst back onto the scene.   They'll face a Buc defense this week ranked # 6 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 11 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 9 Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs Tampa Bay Passing Game vs Philadelphia Defense Brad Johnson is trying to set a dink and dunk record I think.   He had 90 yards passing on 29 attempts for an amazing 3.10 yards per attempt. Keyshawn Johnson is still probably a starter but that's pathetic.   This week, they'll face an Eagle defense that's ranked # 23 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 2 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 1 Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs. /**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/ Defensive Slam Dunks:  These games feature a Defense that's been very strong lately. Arizona Passing Game vs Washington Defense Start David Boston.   You already know that.   I'd say Plummer merits consideration in lots of leagues too.   Boston again went nuts last week. The Redskins rank # 4 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 5 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 11 Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.   Even with this tough matchup, Boston is a sure starter unless you're comically loaded at WR. Buffalo Passing Game vs Miami Defense Van Pelt threw for under 200 yards but the Bills did get the win.   It looks to me like Jay Riemersma is the primary target now.   Eric Moulds and Peerless Price are good gambles but far from sure things.   The Dolphins rank # 2 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 6 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 10 Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs. Detroit Passing Game vs Dallas Defense Mike McMahon could miss another game which means Ty Detmer could start. Sounds funny, but he put together one of the bigger days among QBs Sunday. He threw the ball all over the field.  Johnnie Morton and Cory Schlesinger were especially involved.   The Cowboys rank # 1 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks so it'll be tough.   For the year, they rank # 4 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 3 Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs. /**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/ Bryant Analytics, Inc.

(Yes, even after last week's performance)  The matchup info is meant to be just one more tool in your box when it comes to deciding between players. Stats are provided by Mike Hall's excellent FLM League Management Software. http://www.fflm.com/ for more info.   Fantasy Points Allowed by position numbers are from ESPN.com.   Target numbers are from our Footballguy Andy Hicks. Let's get to it. Joe /**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/ Locks:  These games feature Defenses that have struggled lately. Baltimore's Terry Allen vs Minnesota Defense Terry Allen ran hard last week where he rushed 20 times for 74 yards (3.3 ypc) against a tough Buc team.   It'll be much easier this week against the swiss cheese Vikings ranked # 30 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks.   Although, these Vikings did shut down Ahman Green last week. For the year, they rank # 31 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs. Denver's Terrell Davis vs Indianapolis Defense Terrell Davis looked good again rushing for 89 yards on 18 carries (4.9 ypc) It's been a tough year and you can bet he'll want to finish strong.   The Colts rank # 23 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks. For the year, they rank # 29 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs. New England's Antowain Smith vs Carolina Defense A rested Antowain Smith faces the soft Carolina defense that's ranked # 31 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 20 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.   Great matchup. Pittsburgh's Chris Fuamatu-Ma'afala / Jerome Bettis vs Cleveland Defense Fuamatu-Ma'afala was a workhorse on the ground Sunday but didn't have a lot to show for it.   He ran 25 times for 55 yards (2.2 ypc)   He did score on a receiving TD.   He'll face a weak Cleveland defense ranked # 29 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 20 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs. Washington's Stephen Davis vs Arizona Defense Stephen Davis looked great rushing for 111 yards on 21 carries (5.3 ypc) and the score.   He left with a knee tweak but it doesn't look to be serious. Ki-Jana Carter played great after Davis left.   The Cardinals rank # 21 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 22 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs. /**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/ Prime Matchups:  These games feature Defenses that haven't been strong lately. Buffalo's Shawn Bryson / Travis Henry / Sammy Morris vs Miami Defense Bryson ran wild again rushing 28 times for 107 yards (3.8 ypc).   Sammy Morris spelled him for a few carries and looked good too but it seems Bryson is clearly the man here.   It's possible Henry could see action so keep an eye on this one through the week.   The Dolphins have fallen down to # 28 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 17 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs. Dallas' Emmitt Smith vs Detroit Defense Emmitt looked very solid again rushing for 126 yards on 26 carries (4.8 ypc) although he failed to score.   He needs a little over 60 yards to get 1,000 for the season so you can bet he'll be gunning for that.   The Lions rank # 18 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks and # 24 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs. New York Giants' Tiki Barber / Ron Dayne vs Green Bay Defense Barber saw more action with 16 carries and 71 yards (4.4 ypc) but it was Dayne who scored with 59 yards on 8 carries (7.4 ypc)   Barber was very active again in the passing game.   The Packers let Michael Bennett run well Sunday and have slipped to # 27 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 13 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs. New York Jet's Curtis Martin vs Oakland Defense Martin put in another Martin Like day with 115 yards on 19 carries (6.1 ypc) The Jets may have problems, but Martin isn't one.   He'll face an Oakland defense ranked # 19 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks. For the year, they rank # 21 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs. Oakland's Charlie Garner vs New York Jets Defense The Raiders don't look nearly as strong as they did.   Garner only had 9 carries Sunday for 23 yards (2.6 ypc)   Tyrone Wheatley only had 5 carries. This week they've got a nice matchup as they'll face the Jets ranked # 26 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 27 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs. Seattle's Shaun Alexander vs Kansas City Defense Alexander didn't do much Sunday rushing 23 times for 59 yards (2.6 ypc)   He 'll be ok though and gets to face a Chief defense ranked # 22 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 23 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs. St. Louis' Marshall Faulk vs Atlanta Defense Start Faulk.   The question will be of course how much he plays but it was pretty obvious Sunday that Mike Martz lets his guys play.   Trung Canidate could have really used the work but he warmed the bench while Faulk went nuts.   I'd say you'll get at least a half, maybe much more out of Faulk and half of Faulk is worth more than most backs.   The Falcons rank # 24 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks and # 28 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs. /**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/ Even Matchups:  These games feature no real advantage either way Arizona's Michael Pittman vs Washington Defense Just when it looked like Michael Pittman was going to take over the clear cut # 1 RB role, Thomas Jones steps in with 16 carries.   Pittman rushed 12 times for 89 yards (7.4 ypc) which was bolstered by a 39 yarder.   Jones ran for 69 yards on 16 carries (4.3 ypc)   This was Carolina, though.   This week will feature a tougher test with Washington ranked # 8 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they've been pretty soft though and rank # 25 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs. Kansas City's Priest Holmes / Tony Richardson vs Seattle Defense Priest Holmes ran 27 times for 91 yards (3.4 ypc) plus the score.   Tony Richardson didn't have a carry.   This week, he'll face the Seahawks ranked # 12 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 14 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs. Miami's Lamar Smith / Travis Minor vs Buffalo Defense This is getting embarrassing.   Smith rushed 7 times for 4 yards (0.6 ypc) Travis Minor had 33 yards on 9 carries (3.7 ypc)   He's becoming less and less of a factor with each game.   The Dolphins are in the playoffs but find themselves playing a different style of ball than they have been.   Minor's a threat to go long on the screen passes and Smith is a long shot for a cheap TD.   They'll face the Bills ranked # 13 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks and # 26 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs. Minnesota's Michael Bennett vs Baltimore Defense We said Bennett just needed carries and he got them Sunday rushing 25 times for 104 yards (4.2 ypc)   He'll face a Baltimore defense that's numbers don' t back up it's reputation this week - they rank # 25 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 2 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs. New Orleans' Ricky Williams vs San Francisco Defense Even though he didn't score, it was a better performance by Williams who rushed 17 times for 74 yards (4.4 ypc)   The Saints clearly want him to be more involved as he was Sunday.   This week, he'll face a 49er defense ranked # 17 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks and # 18 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs. San Francisco's Garrison Hearst vs New Orleans Defense Garrison Hearst was a non factor Sunday with just 35 yards on 11 carries (3.2 ypc)   Kevan Barlow didn't do much either so it wasn't like he lost time to another player.   This week, he gets the Saints who rank # 15 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 19 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs. Tampa Bay's Warrick Dunn / Mike Alstott vs Philadelphia Defense Tampa's One-Two punch continues to work.   Alstott had 80 yards on 14 carries (5.7 ypc) and Dunn carried the ball 13 times for 47 yards (3.6 ypc) Alstott's been more effective on the ground but Dunn seems to be more involved in the passing game.   This week, they'll face an Eagle defense ranked # 20 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks and # 9 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs. /**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/ Downside Matchups:  These games feature a Defense that's been pretty strong lately. Cincinnati's Corey Dillon vs Tennessee Defense Dillon showed again he can run on any defense.   He had 91 yards on 21 carries (4.3 ypc) against the Steelers.   He'll face the Titans this week ranked # 6 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks so it won 't get much easier.   They rank # 15 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs. Detroit's Lamont Warren / James Stewart vs Dallas Defense The Detroit RBs were horrible on the ground in this one with Lamont Warren gaining 19 yards on 6 carries (3.2 ypc).   Cory Schlesinger did catch 11 passes though so maybe he's worth a longshot pick there.   The Cowboys rank # 14 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks and # 12 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs. Green Bay's Ahman Green vs New York Giants Defense Green was shut down on the ground with just 31 yards on 16 carries (1.9 ypc) although he did score.   Go figure.   He's still too good to sit in my opinion.   This week, he'll face the Giants ranked # 10 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 3 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs so it's a tough matchup, although I think I'd start Green unless you really have a solid alternative. Indianapolis' Dominic Rhodes vs Denver Defense Again, Dominic Rhodes looked excellent rushing for 83 yards on 20 carries (4.2 ypc) with a score.   He'll face the Broncos this week ranked # 7 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 4 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.   The Broncos are definitely surging after the win in Oakland but I still like Rhodes. Jacksonville's Stacey Mack vs Chicago Defense Mack went off last week with 125 yards on 16 carries (7.8 ypc) and a score. It'll be tougher this week against Chicago that ranks # 9 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 10 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs. Philadelphia's Duce Staley vs Tampa Bay Defense Staley's receiving numbers had been carrying him lately and this week he paid the price.   He only rushed 8 times for 23 yards (2.9 ypc) and was shut  down receiving with just 2 receptions for -1 yards.   This week, he'll face a surging Buc defense ranked # 16 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks and # 11 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs. Tennessee's Eddie George vs Cincinnati Defense Eddie George looked the old Eddie Sunday with 130 yards on 26 carries (5.0 ypc)   Plus 2 scores.  This week he'll face a Bengal defense ranked # 11 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 7 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs. /**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/ Defensive Slam Dunks:  These games feature a Defense that's been very strong lately. Atlanta's Maurice Smith vs St. Louis Defense Again, Maurice Smith ran poorly but got a cheap TD.   He managed just 38 yards on 15 carries (2.5 ypc).   Bob Christian stole 10 carries where he gained 33 yards (3.3 ypc)   They're both a gamble against a tough Ram defense ranked # 3 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks. For the year, they rank # 5 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs. Carolina's Richard Huntley vs New England Defense Huntley ran pretty well last week gaining 62 yards on 12 carries (5.2 ypc). He just didn't get enough carries for this awful Carolina team.   That won't get any better this week agains the Patriots ranked # 2 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 16 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs. Chicago's Anthony Thomas vs Jacksonville Defense Thomas ran 25 times for 76 yards (3.0 ypc) Sunday.   He'll face a tougher defense in Jacksonville that's been awesome lately ranking # 1 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 8 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.   Thomas is still probably a starter in most leagues, but the Jaguars have been extremely stingy of late. Cleveland's Jamel White vs Pittsburgh Defense White only had 42 yards on 21 carries (2.0 ypc) but did score twice.   Corey Dillon showed the Steeler defense wasn't perfect last week.  They're still tough though ranked # 4 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 1 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs. /**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/ That'll do it for the Rushing Matchups.   Passing Matchups to follow.

There are great expectations that  this comprehensive and unique restructuring model, combined with favorable  market conditions, will produce a viable retail market. As a result, Texas  could be the lone star in what has been otherwise a largely disappointing  market space. * Market fundamentals should support retail competition as Texas moves into a  supply surplus, providing an opportunity for competitive suppliers to earn a  margin. * Large customer load will switch to competitive suppliers well ahead of small  customer load. * Regardless of its success, the Texas retail market will have significant  short-term and long-term effects on retail markets nationwide. **end** Follow above URL for complete CERA Private Report.

Loss of demand due to economic weakness is exacerbated by the impact  of the tragedy of September 11. Lower prices have already slowed drilling  activity. Although ample storage levels will guard against last year's peaks,  gas prices will likely to continue to oscillate in the near term.   * The US gas supply rebound expected after record drilling rates is now  unlikely. CERA expects only modest production increases for 2001 and a year- over-year decline for 2002. * CERA has analyzed two paths for demand recovery depending on the severity and  length of the economic downturn. Generally, the large overbuild of gas-fired  generating plants and the recovery of industrial demand should cause much of  the lost demand to return in 2002. **end** Follow above URL for complete CERA Watch (38 printed pages).

We wanted to orientate you to your new environment and inform you about the future technology coming on-line in the coming weeks.  Occupancy Guidebook To Enron Center South You will find this handy guide on your desk; it contains information concerning the enhanced printer environment, the new easy access keyboards and telephony procedures. NEC Monitors The NEC monitors have an internal anti-glare screen to help reduce eye strain and eliminate the need to install an additional screen cover.  Additionally, an integrated speaker has been installed on one monitor for each desk. Turret Users An ""Alliance MX turret quick reference guide"" has been placed on your desk; this includes important information about the new features such as ""Caller ID"" and ""Voicemail Indication"". Increased Information Access There are many NEC 50"" Plasma screens installed on the 5th and 6th floors.  While many of these will be displaying information designed for the specific unit, others will be displaying various television channels.  The audio to these television channels can be accessed via any of your telephony equipment.  Here's how: Ten audio channels have been set up for access from your either your Avaya telephone, Stentophon, or IPC Turret.  The channels have been defined on Page 15 of your Turret.  To access the audio from either your Avaya or Stentophon, simply dial the extensions shown in the table below:   Channel	Avaya	Stentophon	 Weather Channel	12401	801	 CNN Headlines News	12402	802	 CNN Financial News	12403	803	 CNBC	12404	804	 MSNBC	12405	805	 Bloomberg	12406	806	 Financial News Network	12407	807	 CNN	12408	808	 Fox Sports	12409	809	 ESPN1	12410	810	 Wireless Telephony You may notice the cellular phone coverage is not consistent across the floor, and some areas have virtually no coverage at all.  We are implementing a multi-network ""in-building"" system to provide consistent high quality service for the campus, keeping you in touch while you are on the move.   Wireless LAN The infrastructure to support Wireless LAN technology is in place and is being tested. We will be implementing multi level encryption and security to keep our intellectual property safe from eavesdroppers or hackers. Amtel Replacement As a move to provide a more flexible ""Plug n Play"" environment and to help with the reduced desk footprint, we have replaced the Amtel message boxes with Microsoft Exchange Instant Messaging. The Global Messaging Team is testing additional software products to provide some of the features not available with Exchange Instant Messaging; these include one-touch response keys, external LED display, and printing.  Updates will be provided as they become available. Keeping an Open forum We will keep you informed of the changes and developments as the migration to the building continues, please feel free to respond with any comments, queries or suggestions to  mailto:Enron.Center.South.Technology@enron.com subject: Enron Center South Technology Watch "

Producers' drilling plans for the  2002 budget year are already being curtailed.   *  The drilling downturn could mean as many as 8,000 fewer gas wells in the  United States over the next 12 months and 1.5 to 2.0 billion cubic feet per day  of lost production. *  The majority of the activity reduction is onshore, but the significant drop  in Gulf of Mexico shallow shelf drilling will have a huge impact on productive  capacity.   *  Gas supply could be extremely tight once again next year just as the economy  recovers, and gas demand is expected to rebound with it. **end** Follow above URL for complete report.

Western gas markets have also entered a bust with the  delayed start to winter and full storage inventories exerting downward pressure  on both North American prices and western basis differentials.

bryant@cheatsheets.net,0,0,0.949,9715afd6-d170-41c5-b852-ad7443c34855,"body: Hi Folks, Once again, our Footballguy Scott Luebke throws out what he sees for this week's Upgrades and Downgrades. Enjoy. Joe /**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/ Upgrades QB - Tom Brady - Brady has remains the starter in New England despite the return of Drew Bledsoe from injury.  Some analysts may question the fact that Bledsoe lost his job due to an injury, but no one can question Brady's effectiveness on the football field.  A 258 yard, 4 touchdown performance keeps Brady entrenched as the Patriots starter.  Keep in mind, the Patriots have a bye in week 16. QB - Kordell Stewart - Stewart looked good on Sunday with his second consecutive multiple touchdown game.  Stewart finished the game with 254 passing yards, 54 rushing yards and 3 total touchdowns.  The schedule looks good for Stewart down the stretch, especially with games against Detroit and Cincinnati in weeks 15 and 16. QB - Jay Fiedler - Fiedler has found a quality weapon in rookie Chris Chambers.  Fiedler has been an up and down quarterback this season, but his upside is good.  A quality schedule throughout the remainder of the season should allow ample opportunity for solid fantasy stats. QB - Alex Van Pelt - Since stepping into the lineup for Rob Johnson, Van Pelt has been a fantasy star.  With two consecutive 300+ yards games to match with 5 touchdowns, Van Pelt deserves starter consideration against weaker opponents.  Look for another quality performance against the 49ers this weekend. RB - Dominic Rhodes - With Edgerrin James sidelined for the season, Rhodes has been asked to do a lot in the Colts offense.  He produced on Sunday with 147 total yards and 2 touchdowns.  Two consecutive difficult games against Baltimore and Miami will slow Rhodes down, but a strong finish to the season is in store.  With Manning and the passing game throwing interceptions, look for Coach Mora to run a more conservative offense featuring Rhodes. RB - Antowain Smith - Smith jumps into the upgrades category once again with 153 total yards and 2 touchdowns.  However, now is the time to trade Smith away.  His value has hit an all-time high and the remainder of the season will be difficult with Cleveland, Miami and a bye week remaining. RB - Ahman Green - Green has struggled the last few weeks, but was able to bust out on Thanksgiving Day with 150 total yards and 2 scores.  Look for the Green Bay offense to revolve around Green for the remainder of the season.  As the winter weather approaches, Favre and the passing game will become more conservative, which will result in more dump off passes to the talented Green.  Don't be surprised if Green receives 30+ touches/game the remainder of the season. RB - LaDainian Tomlinson - Tomlinson's statistics have suffered over the last several weeks with the opposition focusing on the run.  In order to get the ball in Tomlinson's hands more often, Turner called several short passing plays to get LT in the open field.  The plan was successful as Tomlinson caught 13 passes for 72 yards.  The fantasy playoffs look good for Tomlinson with Oakland, Kansas City and Seattle on the schedule for weeks 14, 15, and 16. RB - Garrison Hearst - Hearst looked strong again on Sunday with 106 rushing yards and 2 touchdowns.  In the last 4 games, Hearst has averaged 106 rushing yards/game.  With rookie Kevan Barlow separating his shoulder on Sunday to go along with an already injured quad, Hearst will continue to see 20+ touches per game and be a quality fantasy option in the fantasy playoffs as long as he remains healthy. WR - Derrick Alexander - Good news for Alexander owners...it appears that he is 100% healthy for the first time this season. WR - Eric Moulds - Throughout the week, Moulds was complaining about the lack of balls thrown in his direction and how the team was using him.  Well, the complaint department contacted management and Moulds got the ball.  What happened when the ball was thrown to Moulds?  He produced (196 yards and 2 touchdowns). WR - Chris Chambers - The talented rookie struck once again on Sunday with 101 receiving yards and 2 fabulous touchdowns.  Chambers is the big play threat in the Miami offense and should continue to see action.  Keep in mind, Chambers is a boom/bust option at receiver.  He'll dazzle you one week and disappear the next week.  This guy is going to be special, so grab him in dynasty leagues. WR - David Boston - Plain and simple...the man.  A few weeks ago, the knock on Boston was his lack of touchdown scoring.  Well, 4 touchdowns in 3 weeks should quiet the critics. WR - Kevin Johnson - Johnson jumped back in the scoring column on Sunday with 113 yards and a touchdown.  Johnson is Tim Couch's clear cut #1 receiver and should remain a consistent fantasy threat for the rest of the season. WR - Troy Brown - Brown continues to produce quality numbers on a consistent basis.  With 7 catches for 91 yards and a touchdown on Sunday, Brown continues to have a quality rapport with QB Tom Brady.  Keep in mind, New England has a bye in week 16, so Brown will not be available for the majority of championship games.  Plan accordingly. /**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/ Downgrades QB - Trent Green - Green's disappointing season continues.  He looked good with 256 passing yards and zero interceptions on Sunday.  However, he was unable to throw any touchdowns and that stat leads to the downgrade.  With the healthy return of Alexander at wide receiver, Green's stock could be on the rise in the near future.  Green's value is at its lowest point, so you could probably get him for relatively cheap.  He's not an every week starter, but he might have a few big games left for this season. QB - Donovan McNabb - McNabb has looked horrendous in the pocket over the last two weeks (221 passing yards and 1 touchdown).  His pride of wanting to be a quality pocket passer is getting in the way of his production. McNabb's value will be dependent on his ability to scramble and make some plays. Right now, McNabb should still be considered a top 10 fantasy quarterback.  However, if his lack of production continues, his stock will drop quickly. QB - Brian Griese - Griese's receiving options are limited, which is directly affecting his production.  Rod Smith limped through Thursday's game with an ankle injury.  A healthy return of Smith will boost Griese's stock. However, Griese needs some quality production from the other receiver position.  His production is limited, if he is forced to throw to the tight end position the majority of the time. QB - Daunte Culpepper - Culpepper did not pass/score a touchdown for the first time in his two seasons as the starting quarterback for the Vikings. Another difficult challenge at Pittsburgh is upcoming this week. RB - Anthony Thomas - Thomas was held out of Sunday's game with a hamstring injury.  He's expecting to play this weekend against Detroit, but this is not a guarantee.  With James Allen being effective, it would not surprise me to see the Bears hold Thomas out for another game to ensure a healthy hamstring for the stretch run towards the playoffs.  A big game looms in two weeks against Green Bay and the Bears will need a healthy Thomas in that game. RB - Emmitt Smith - Smith was held to 9 yards on 9 carries during the Thanksgiving Day game.  Until the Cowboys can establish a passing game, Smith's numbers will remain meager. RB - Ron Dayne - With Tiki Barber establishing himself as the first option in the rushing game, Dayne's fantasy value has dropped very low.  Dayne had 26 yards on 6 carries.  Barber had 124 rushing yards on 19 carries, 5 receptions for 41 yards and a touchdown.  Keep Dayne on your bench. RB - Jason Brookins - Brookins broke his foot in Sunday's game against the Jaguars.  He is expected to be out for 4-6 weeks.  Drop him and add someone else to the roster. RB - Eddie George - George's disappointing season continues with 58 yards on 15 carries this past Sunday.  George is currently tied with Randy Moss for ""Fantasy Disappointment of the Year"". RB - Maurice Smith - Smith sprained his ankle on Sunday and managed to return to the game.  However, Smith gained a meager 57 yards on 21 carries and seemed to be bother by the ankle sprain.  Evaluate his progress later this week. WR - Jimmy Smith - Smith tested positive for cocaine in his system after being pulled over by police.  No legal action will occur, but some sort of suspension could be handed down by the commissioner's office.  Not a good sign as we head closer to the fantasy playoffs. WR - Peter Warrick - Warrick suffered a bruised shoulder against Cleveland on Sunday. He was held to 1 reception for 22 yards and has not scored a touchdown since week 4 of the season.  Keep him on your bench until the Cincinnati passing game reappears. WR - Randy Moss - Moss was held to 25 yards on 4 catches Sunday night.  Moss is the most talented receiver in the league, but appears to lose concentration from time to time.  Keep in mind, his potential for explosive games is enormous. /**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/ Waiver Wire Keep in mind, the waiver wire analysis selections are based off of 12 and 14 team leagues. QB - Alex Van Pelt - Since stepping into the lineup for Rob Johnson, Van Pelt has been a fantasy star.  With two consecutive 300+ yards games to match with 5 touchdowns, Van Pelt deserves starter consideration against weaker opponents. RB - James Allen - Allen stepped in for the injured Anthony Thomas and performed admirably.  With Thomas bothered by a hamstring injury, it's highly possible that Allen could start against the lowly Detroit Lions this weekend.  Chicago's defense is strong and the Bears like to grind it out on the ground. RB - Travis Minor - With Lamar Smith averaging just 2.3 yds/carry over the last 6 games, Minor may be given his opportunity to shine very soon.  In his limited touches, Minor has looked good and could give the Dolphins offense a much needed spark. WR - Chris Chambers - This guy is good.  See description in upgrades section. TE - Eddie ""Boo"" Williams - I had Williams on the list last week and his play on Sunday deserves another mention.  Although he had just 2 catches for 44 yards, Williams has explosive potential.  He nearly scored on a 25 yard pass play, but had the ball ripped out of his hands at the last second. With Cam Cleeland remaining out with an injury, Williams is a tight end with quality upside. /**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/ Bryant Analytics, Inc.

URL(s):	 http://www.cera.com/eprofile?u=35&m=2811; *********************************************************************** A SMALL STEP FOR SPAIN, BUT AN IMPORTANT STEP FOR EUROPE The recent auction of contract gas in Spain represents an early initiative both  to release gas from preexisting long-term contracts and to make it available to  aspiring market entrants. As such, CERA believes it could provide a precedent  for other European markets (and for their regulators) where release gas  programs have not so far been on the public agenda.  *  The Spanish gas release program, as currently devised, will have limited  impact on domestic competition. However, pressure will grow in Spain to extend  the program. *  By setting a unique precedent across Continental Europe, Spain has signaled  a possible path for the reforms needed on the supply-side to complete the  European gas internal market. *  The role of credit risk and sovereign guarantees will be critical in any  reallocation or renegotiation of long-term contracts. **end** Follow above URL for complete Insight (4 printed pages).

EnTelligence training now available! Date: Tuesday, Dec 12 Time: 3:00 and 4:00 Location: EB 572 Please stop by to learn more about the system or just get a demo of what it  can do for you!!! Overview EnTelligence is a web-based prospecting tool designed to deliver market  information on existing and potential customers to commercial trading,  mid-marketing, and origination teams.  It also delivers management reports to  analyze Enron,s position within the key industries that we serve.  Presently,  commercial groups have multiple methods for acquiring potential customer  information.  This system will standardize their resource tools and add  consistency to their prospecting processes.  EnTelligence combines  information from internal databases such as Global Counterparty, Credit  Aggregation System (CAS), Sitara, and ERMS with information from external  data sources such as Dun & Bradstreet and I.H.S Energy Reporter to identify  customer prospects.  By providing the capability to filter and search by  region, industry, company size, or energy consumption levels, the prospecting  process is shortened and the identification of strong prospects improved.  Available reports include Market Penetration, Industry Prospecting,  Comparison Prospecting, Company Profiles, Family Tree, Top Customers, and  Inactive Accounts.  Soon to come is the Activity Details report in mid  January.  Currently only Natural Gas and Power physical deals are loaded, but  financial deals will be included in mid January, and new products are soon to  follow.

Basically, I started off with your proposed procedures  and made a few changes that Enron needs to make sure that right amount of gas shows up  at the correct time. Also, we are suggesting a confirmation form be sent back and forth between  Enron and Sithe every day.  This will help document all the small little details and  costs so that we both drop anything through the cracks.  I am suggesting that we e-mail this  confirm form to the right folks in both our companies, so that no one is left out of the  loop. You will also notice our attempt to make sure that everyone has a clear  understanding of exactly what is included in the numbers that are reported to Enron's  traders.  The timing of your calls will be when everyone is very busy in our trading group.  There  will not be much time to have long conversations, but it is very important that everyone have  the same understanding what the numbers mean. Please take a look at this on your side and see if there are some other  things that need to be included. Thanks, Ruth subject: Procedures for Incremental Empire Gas for On-Peak Day Ahead Market "

webmaster@cera.com,0,0,0.447,b5747240-3f03-405f-ac03-9232487dbbbb,"body: CERA Alert: Dcember 13, 2000  Title: California on the Brink  CERA Knowledge Areas: Western Energy, N. American Power, N. American Gas  CALIFORNIA ON THE BRINK  The California Stalemate  California moved closer to the brink of an outage today as concerns over  credit-worthiness of buyers brought the possibility that generators would  avoid selling to the California market. While numerous factors have  contributed to the high cost of power incurred by California's utilities, the  root cause of the current crisis is a lack of new generation. The current  credit crisis and its threat to supplies could spark state action to address  the situation. The collective efforts of all market participants should be  focused on increasing generation capacity as quickly as possible. Western power prices have skyrocketed well beyond the record levels set this  summer. Perhaps because frozen rates insulate the majority of California  consumers and companies from tangible effects of the market crisis,  regulators have been able to postpone meaningful market reforms and  significant rate increases. The California Public Utilities Commission denied  the requests of Pacific Gas & Electric and Southern California Edison to end  their rate freezes, forcing these utilities at least temporarily to finance  the costs of higher wholesale energy. This has created an unsustainable  accumulation of costs and a loss of faith in the California market.  The current credit crisis and the potential for blackouts may become the  galvanizing events that provide state regulators with a public mandate to  address the underlying structural problems in the industry. However, there is  no guarantee that these regulatory actions will expedite an effective  solution for customers and the industry as a whole. Wholesale and retail  markets that emerge from regulatory intervention are likely to remain  muddled. In the necessarily political process that will follow, it is  possible that-as has largely been the case so far-the steps taken will fail  to move the California power market toward a more enduring solution and will  instead continue to mask the underlying structural flaws.  In the six months since California's supply shortfall began plaguing Western  markets, regulators have done little to address the underlying problem.  Rather than addressing the cause of the supply shortage-establishing a market  environment that encourages timely additions of new generating capacity and  demand side responses-efforts are instead directed at trying to lay blame for  the crisis and lessen the immediate financial impact on customers. Indeed,  several actions taken thus far have served more to compound the problem by  discouraging new power plant additions. These include price caps, repeated  changes to market rules, attempts to seize generator profits, and a  challenging siting and permitting process. Medicine Worse than the Illness  Several years of electricity demand growth and low prices in California were  accompanied by very few additions to the supply base. Regulators did not pay  adequate attention to the looming supply shortfall. The void of consensus  over the cause of the current crisis has instead been replaced by a series of  bandaid remedies that address the symptoms, but not the cause, of  California's electric market woes.*  * Challenging siting and permitting. Despite state action to better  coordinate the siting and permitting process for new power plants, power  plant developers still face high hurdles. Local community opposition alone  has struck down some key proposed facilities. * Price caps discourage investment. State and federal proposals to cap prices  limit the attractiveness of the California wholesale power market, especially  for developers who have the option of channeling scarce capital and equipment  to more stable or more attractive markets outside the state.  * Repeated rule changes. Frequent rule changes in the ISO markets (including  the price caps) confound attempts by developers to estimate profits from new  plant development. * Calls for refunds. Despite reports by the Power Exchange, the ISO, and the  FERC that no pattern of abuse could be found from their examination of the  California markets, state officials continue to accuse power providers of  gaming the market. Calls by state officials for refunds of generator profits  are a threat to new plant development. * Facility inspections. Recent inspections of power plants by state officials  to verify that operators are honestly reporting the operational status of  their generating units accentuates the atmosphere of mistrust. CERA's recent analysis suggests that merchant plant developers in the West  are not guaranteed? to make a profit. Prospects of new plant profitability  are affected by the timing and quantity of new plants, decommissioning of  older units, demand growth, and numerous other difficult-to-forecast factors.  California's regulatory actions only further cloud the assessment of  financial viability and degrade the political environment for developers  considering entering the state.  Despite efforts by the California ISO to stimulate new capacity additions in  the state with a special, limited-term capacity payment, CERA estimates that  demand growth will continue to outstrip supply additions in the West in 2001.  In addition, the existing siting and permitting process will prevent a  sufficient quantity of capacity from entering the market until 2003 at the  earliest. Therefore, three years remain before a sufficient quantity of  capacity enters service to significantly dampen prices and decrease the risk  of an outage.  The Road to Recovery  There are a number of actions that can be taken to help relieve the capacity  shortfall:  * Encourage new build. Supply must be part of the answer. This requires a  series of steps that can help facilitate new supply build. While in principal  some have been taken, such as new fast track approval, the success of these  actions can only be measured by the build itself. For now, there is still not  enough new supply coming on until 2003 to relieve supply tightness.?  * Stabilize investment climate. Utilities must have assurance that they will  ultimately be allowed to recover market costs for power. This provides the  credit worthiness needed by sellers to produce energy and to stimulate new  build. * Move toward more balanced utility supply portfolios. One of the reasons the  pressure on customers has been so intense in California has been the absence  (and even discouragement) of diverse supply portfolios among the utilities in  the state-particularly for residential and small commercial customers. With  the market at a peak, however, now is in one sense a sub-optimal time to move  toward term contracting. Yet these contracts provide the foundation for a  series of actions-including new supply build and demand side investments. If  they end up above market, they will at least have achieved the desired effect  of knocking down prices, a fact which by itself should provide sufficient  justification for recovering the cost of these commitments. * Encourage market mechanisms that elicit a demand response. Although  originally a feature of California's market design, most consumers are  insulated from price spikes through capped or frozen retail rates. Exposing  customers to at least some of the market price signals would encourage a  demand response. * Encourage market mechanisms that dampen the ""Boom Bust"" characteristic of  the market. Whether in the form of a capacity payment, a reserve requirement,  or a minimum term portfolio requirement, the California power market needs to  move to a structure that encourages investment in new capacity when the  market is in balance rather than waiting for a shortage and price shock to  elicit new investment. Such a structure can help dampen (but not eliminate)  future price volatility. * Avoid continuously tinkering with the market. While the market does need to  be restructured as described above, it also needs to be stable and reliable  to encourage the development of new supply as well as a robust long-term  contractual market for power in California. Continually tinkering with the  market structure-such as the three times the price cap has been shifted since  July-only serves to undermine confidence in the market. California needs to  do its best to develop a long-term solution and then let the market run its  course.  * Allow for greater environmental flexibility. The state should explore a  more balanced solution to emissions restrictions in the face of a supply  shortfall that has been exacerbated by generators that cannot operate due to  emissions restrictions.  * Free PURPA power plants to generate. Relief should be granted to PURPA  power plants that are operational, but are restricted by contract from  operating to generate only power.  **end**  This CERA Alert will be available in PDF format within 24 hours.  **********************************************************************  This electronic message and attachments, if any, contain information  from Cambridge Energy Research Associates, Inc.

zwharton@dawray.com,0,0,0.364,56443d2e-9354-49b1-8ac6-30e37b98bf6d,"body:  FYI - I just recently paid for a portion of our At&T bill with the rest of the free money in our Waterhouse account (wrote a check in the amount of like $2200).  The remaining balance is something like $2,500.  All of that amount is allocated to our monthly savings for property/school taxes.  I guess what you're saying is you would like to borrow from this savings account to make this investment.  As long as you feel confident that we will be able to reimburse that amount somehow to pay our taxes (should we not get a return on the investment), then I guess we should go for it if it's something you're excited about and believe is a good investment. Naturally, I would prefer we only invest $500 because of the risk involved and Christmas just around the corner, but you're the one with the financial instincts and know-how.

Hey how much of the money in our Waterhouse account is budgeted for expenses.  I am thinking that it would be a good investment (speculative in nature though) to purchase some options on Enron.  The options would expire in January and the potential return could vary between a loss of 100% of the investment to a 400%-500% return.  I think between a $500-$1,000 investment would be wise given the nature of it. MC subject: RE: ??????? "

I  looked and some of your funds haven't done so well this year especially Low  Priced Stock.  Also, I am worried about earnings for many companies with  energy prices so high and the prospect of very high prices this winter.  I  don't know but it might be prudent to even move some money into cash or up  your bond exposure.  I'll try to call you and talk about it later.  If I  don't talk to you in the next couple of days remind me and maybe we can look  at some options when you are here for the wedding. subject: "

The data includes max temp, max temp deviation from normal (ie if max is 88  and normal max is 86 max temp deviation is +2), min temp, min temp deviation  from normal and percent of precipitation.  So far things are looking good.   We are getting a cold front this weekend (hitting Texas on Monday) and looks  like things should be beautiful for next weekend.  I wouldn't be that worried  about the rain either - the reason the POP is so high right now is tropical  moisture in the Gulf of Mexico and that will blow through this weekend.   After that the tropics settle down and it is much less likely to get  tropical  moisture.

martin.cuilla@enron.com,0,0,0.324,c67bf6e9-5793-4997-91e7-68b6f581fe72,"body: Amy and Alec are definitely welcome!  Actually we had already planned on Amy  and Alec coming and a couple who we are friends with is bringing their  daughter, our flower girl, who is about 4 years old.  We have a whole room to  ourselves at the restaurant so Amy and Alec should be fine.  I talked to  grandma and she said Julie wouldn't be able to make it so I already knew  about that.  Don't worry about having 4 more people, the only reason we were  cautious about inviting aunts and uncles was we didn't want to open up the  flood gates but most of them already live in Houston or aren't going to make  it to Houston until late Friday.  As far as the bill just let me know what  you are comfortable with and we will pick up the rest.  The food bill with  tax and tip will be about $1,350.  We are very appreciative to have both our  parent's help as we quickly found that weddings are very expensive.  However,  we are both adults with good careers and try to be very self-sufficient.   Also, we realize that some things we do seem extravagant by our parents  standards.  We could have just as easily had a rehearsal at a Mexican  restaurant and it would have been cheaper - however we would rather have  things a certain way and pay for the difference.  Also, I know that you guys  are on a tight budget with the building of your house.  The bottom line is  that we are grateful for any help we receive and have the resources to pay  the balance.  Our most  important concern is that all our family and friends  to have a great time.  While I am on the subject, I hope your mother and  grandma Ina aren't going to get their feeling hurt about people drinking wine  at the dinner.  If you think they will please mention it to them on the way  down because I don't want them to be offended but I can't change who Zooey  and I are.  Just so you know we will have dinner and desert and then there  will be several toasts starting with the best man (James Cook) and the matron  of honor (Amber) and then probably ending in Zooey and me doing a quick  toast.  We would love for all our family to be there but if grandmother or  Betty Joyce is going to get offended and don't want to stay I understand.   Also, do you know if Skipper is planning to attend.  We haven't received a  reply card as to whether he will be there or not.  As to this weekend, I am  going to try to stop by but don't have a car so just depends what is going  on.  I will be in Dallas so if Mark is coming over Saturday afternoon I could  get a ride from him.  I'll try to talk to him and see if that works.   Finally, we are both really looking forward to our big day and are very glad  to have all our family there to support us!  If you have any questions please  call me tonight at the house. Sharon.Cuilla@nlrb.gov on 09/19/2000 12:57:00 PM To: martin.cuilla@enron.com cc:   Subject: Plans      Hi Marty,      Amy and I were talking over the weekend and she said she did not plan      to attend the rehearsal dinner because there was no one to keep Alec.      Would you and Zooey think it was OK if she came and brought Alec for      dinner only and left as soon as they were through eating?  She said      she did not want to ask you about it because she didn't want you or      Zooey to feel any pressure.  This is your special time and she doesn't      want to detract from it in any way.  I feel sorry for her missing out.      It is hard for Alec to be still and quite for very long but I think he      would be fine while we are eating.  Would you please talk with Zooey      and ask her how she feels about Amy bringing Alec for a while.  Amy      would leave right away if Alec was disturbing anyone.  If you prefer      he doesn't come, just say so.  There will certainly be no hard      feelings over it.      I spoke with Betty Joyce Sunday and Julianna and her husband are not      going to be able to come.  Joyce, Chester, Renee, and Travis (her      boyfriend) are planning to arrive in Houston Friday afternoon the      29th.  Dad and I are bringing Grandma Ina and Mamanet with us and      should arrive early in the afternoon on Friday.  Mike decided to fly      and is coming in Saturday around 4 p.m.  There will be 9 or 11      (depending if Amy comes) of us from our family for the rehearsal      dinner.  I know that is more that you had planned on but I will pay      for the extra people.  Why don't you call me when you have time and we      can talk about it.      Now that Mamanet is coming, she is very excited about the trip.  She      called me yesterday when she got her ticket and she said she had      really wanted to come but didn't think she would have the chance to      come.  I'm glad I was able to work it out.      Grandma Ina will arrive here this week on Thursday.  It seems like I      remember you and Zooey were going to be in town this weekend for her      class reunion.  I know you have a busy schedule and may not have time      to come by, but if you do let me know when and we will plan lunch or      whatever.  If you have time you can see the new house.  It is looking      better every day.      Love,      Mom subject: Re: Plans "

Deputies from the Island County Sheriff's Office said they removed more than 80 marijuana plants -- including 50 or so mature plants -- from a shed behind the 30-year-old man's home on Maple Tree Lane, a dead-end road on the south end of the island.  The strange saga began Saturday night when moviegoers and diners in restaurants near the theater's courtyard reported seeing a naked man walking around the complex in full view of families dining out.  When an officer approached the man and asked why he was walking around naked, the man reportedly said that he felt like it so he just did it. An officer writing the man a ticket for indecent exposure then asked the man what he did for a living, and he allegedly said he grew marijuana.  According to a police report, the man then asked for the officer's help in harvesting the crop. The officer said he was too lazy to help but offered to go look at the man's operation, and the naked man agreed.  In the outbuilding behind the man's mobile home, police found what they described as a ""sophisticated hydroponic grow operation.""  Deputies allegedly found numerous grow lights on timers, fans and a complicated watering system with a line running to each of the plants.  Police said the man seemed proud of his operation, telling them that the system used no dirt, just lava rock, and he picked a large bud from a plant and handed it to an officer.  In a written statement to police, the man allegedly said: ""I grow marijuana for fun and profit, to support myself and my family, to help bring us a better life."" He also said he was growing marijuana for his father, who had a disease, and for other ""medically ill people.""  The man's wife told police she had never been inside her husband's shed, but that was where her husband did his artwork and practiced with his yo-yo.  Deputies said they asked the man what he expected them to do after he showed them his garden, and the man said he didn't expect them to do anything.  Police, however, confiscated the plants and growing equipment. The man was cooperative, they said, even helping to load the equipment into police vehicles.  The man may be charged with manufacture of a controlled substance, but he is not named because charges have not been filed.

We got home too late last night to call you, but I wanted to tell you what a wonderful evening we had and thank you for being such a thoughtful son. Drillion was just great.  I have never seen anything like it!  After seeing Drillion a regular circus would be dull and boring. The Old Warsaw was everything you described and more.  Fur coats and big diamonds are still in style and I saw plenty of them at the Warsaw.   The service was impeccable, the music was soothing and relaxing, and I've never eaten a better meal.  Dad had the lobster thermador and I had the tenderloin.  Everything was absolutely perfect.  The young man at the table next to us proposed to his girlfriend and the ring was hidden under grapes in a silver goblet.  It was very romantic and the staff made a big production of it so we all enjoyed it. I wanted to call you this morning to thank you but I know things are in turmoil at work and I didn't want to disturb you.  We will call this evening. Your wonderful gift was very much appreciated and enjoyed by both Dad and I. Love, Mom   subject: FW: Wonderful Evening! "

The study by Cambridge University examined how loud music strengthens the harmful effects of methamphetamine, the drug commonly known as speed.  Wendy Higgins of the British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection, said: ""These sick experiments are absolutely despicable. Just because people choose to take drugs and go to raves doesn't justify subjecting animals to suffering and death in a laboratory.""  The scientists, who used a total of 238 mice in the experiment, concluded that loud music strengthened the toxic effects of methamphetamine in animals.    <http://images.thisislondon.com/img/blob.gif>Email this article to a friend <http://www.thisislondon.com/dynamic/mailafriend/form.html?in_review_id=470967&in_review_text_id=424979>  ?

The men combine the popular impotence drug with illicit ""club drugs"" such as ecstasy, ketamine, amphetamines, GHB, and ""poppers.""  The study, discussed last week at the Centers for Disease Control's HIV ( news <http://rd.yahoo.com/DailyNews/manual/*http://search.news.yahoo.com/search/news?p=%22HIV%22&c=&n=20&yn=c&c=news&cs=nw> - web sites <http://rd.yahoo.com/DailyNews/manual/*http://search.yahoo.com/bin/search?p=HIV>) Prevention Conference, focuses on high-risk behavior among gay men who use Viagra to heighten their sexual experience.  San Francisco epidemiologist Andrea Kim, who conducted the study, says it and other studies in California and London have shown that ""gay men are combining Viagra with other drugs much more frequently when compared to heterosexual men"" and that puts them at higher risk. Her sa common side effect of club drugs is loss of erection.  ""We know that ecstasy and methamphetamines reduce sexual function, so the men are using Viagra to enhance their sexual ability,"" Kim says.  Partygoers often combine Viagra with amyl nitrite, an inhaled stimulant commonly referred to as ""poppers.""  University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center Chief of Toxicology and emergency room physician Dr. Daniel Keyes says that ""amyl nitrite makes the heart race and combining these drugs can cause cardiac events.""  Like Viagra, amyl nitrite causes blood vessel dilation and a drop in blood pressure. Combining two blood pressure lowering drugs can be fatal if a person has a heart attack or stroke.  Although rare, another medical condition that can occur is priapism, a severely painful problem that can result in permanent damage caused by the penis being erect for many hours. -----Original Message----- From: Cuilla, Martin [mailto:Martin.Cuilla@ENRON.com] Sent: Thursday, August 23, 2001 3:55 PM To: Bill Rasch (E-mail); Carl Frank (E-mail); Dax Philbin (E-mail); James Cook (E-mail); Jason Naples (E-mail); Johnny Perches (E-mail); Mike Contant (E-mail); Rob Miller (E-mail); Shane Rutherford (E-mail); Steve Nadalin (E-mail); Steve Patterson (E-mail); Will Dangerfield (E-mail); Zooey Wharton (E-mail) Subject: This is your brain on drugs       _____     <http://www.heraldnet.com/graphics/UpperCurvesRedo7.gif>   <http://www.heraldnet.com/graphics/spacer.gif>   <http://www.heraldnet.com/graphics/redspacer.gif>		 <http://www.heraldnet.com/>   <http://www.heraldnet.com/graphics/redspacer.gif> A service of The Herald of Everett, Wash. 	   <http://www.heraldnet.com/graphics/redspacer.gif>	   <http://www.heraldnet.com/graphics/spacer.gif>	Local News <http://www.heraldnet.com/localnews/>     Crime & Justice <http://www.heraldnet.com/crime-courts/>    Education <http://www.heraldnet.com/education/>    Environment <http://www.heraldnet.com/environment/>    Health <http://www.heraldnet.com/health/>    Legislature <http://www.heraldnet.com/legislature/>    Lottery <http://www.heraldnet.com/lottery/>    Navy News <http://www.heraldnet.com/navy/>    Neighbors <http://www.heraldnet.com/neighbors/>    Politics <http://www.heraldnet.com/politics/>    Special Reports <http://www.heraldnet.com/specialreports/>    Traffic & Roads <http://www.heraldnet.com/traffic/>    Weather <http://www.heraldnet.com/weather/>    Your County <http://www.heraldnet.com/yourcounty/>	 Sports <http://www.heraldnet.com/sports/> 	 Economy <http://www.heraldnet.com/economy/> 	 News Wire <http://www.heraldnet.com/wire/>	 Columnists <http://www.heraldnet.com/columnists/> 	 Opinion <http://www.heraldnet.com/opinion/> 	 Features <http://www.heraldnet.com/features/> 	 Community <http://www.heraldnet.com/community/> 	 Obituaries <http://www.heraldnet.com/redirect/obituaries.cfm>	 Classifieds <http://www.heraldnet.com/redirect/classified.cfm> 	 Subscriptions <http://www.heraldnet.com/usersguide/subscribe/>	 About Us <http://www.heraldnet.com/about/> 	 Extras <http://www.heraldnet.com/extras/> 	   <http://www.heraldnet.com/graphics/spacer.gif>	   <http://www.heraldnet.com/graphics/spacer.gif>	   <http://www.heraldnet.com/graphics/grayspacer.gif>	  <http://www.heraldnet.com/graphics/triangleright.gif>	  Local News <http://www.heraldnet.com/localnews/>	 Published: Thursday, August 23, 2001	  	 	  <http://forums.heraldnet.com/index.cfm?Forum=3&headline=Police%20follow%20naked%20man%20to%20pot%20crop%20&TopicURL=http%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Eheraldnet%2Ecom%2FStories%2F01%2F8%2F23%2F14257484%2Ecfm>	 @@@@  Police follow naked man to pot crop    <http://www.heraldnet.com/graphics/spacer.gif>   <http://www.heraldnet.com/graphics/spacer.gif> By Brian Kelly  Herald Writer  CAMANO ISLAND -- A naked man found wandering around Stanwood Cinemas led police to his indoor marijuana garden after deputies asked the man what he did for a living, police said Wednesday.  Deputies from the Island County Sheriff's Office said they removed more than 80 marijuana plants -- including 50 or so mature plants -- from a shed behind the 30-year-old man's home on Maple Tree Lane, a dead-end road on the south end of the island.  The strange saga began Saturday night when moviegoers and diners in restaurants near the theater's courtyard reported seeing a naked man walking around the complex in full view of families dining out.  When an officer approached the man and asked why he was walking around naked, the man reportedly said that he felt like it so he just did it. An officer writing the man a ticket for indecent exposure then asked the man what he did for a living, and he allegedly said he grew marijuana.  According to a police report, the man then asked for the officer's help in harvesting the crop. The officer said he was too lazy to help but offered to go look at the man's operation, and the naked man agreed.  In the outbuilding behind the man's mobile home, police found what they described as a ""sophisticated hydroponic grow operation.""  Deputies allegedly found numerous grow lights on timers, fans and a complicated watering system with a line running to each of the plants.  Police said the man seemed proud of his operation, telling them that the system used no dirt, just lava rock, and he picked a large bud from a plant and handed it to an officer.  In a written statement to police, the man allegedly said: ""I grow marijuana for fun and profit, to support myself and my family, to help bring us a better life."" He also said he was growing marijuana for his father, who had a disease, and for other ""medically ill people.""  The man's wife told police she had never been inside her husband's shed, but that was where her husband did his artwork and practiced with his yo-yo.  Deputies said they asked the man what he expected them to do after he showed them his garden, and the man said he didn't expect them to do anything.  Police, however, confiscated the plants and growing equipment. The man was cooperative, they said, even helping to load the equipment into police vehicles.  The man may be charged with manufacture of a controlled substance, but he is not named because charges have not been filed.

I went ahead and ordered the 3 channel package (with cinemax) and they are crediting us for 19.95 for the overcharge.

Which would you recommend (between Montefeltro, Legacy and Super Black Eagle) - I mainly hunt pheasant and quail but would also like a gun that I can hunt ducks and geese with.

""Right about now, I want to send a shout-out to each and every nigga who's shown Me love through the years,"" said the Lord, His booming voice descending from Heaven. ""I got mad love for each and every one of you niggaz. Y'all real niggaz out there, you know who you are. Y'all was there for me, and it's about time I'm-a give some love back to God's true crew.""       ""All y'all niggaz, y'all be My niggaz,"" the Lord added.       As of press time, God has thanked nearly 7,000 of His niggaz, including those in New York's Bad Boy and Ruff Ryders posses, the No Limit soldiers and Cash Money Millionaires holdin' it down in New Orleans, Nelly and the whole St. Lunatics crew, Busta and the rest of the Flipmode Squad, His peeps from back in the day, and all the real ruffneck niggaz in lockdown. He also sent shout-outs to everybody in the Old School, as well as to Lil' Bow Wow and all the other new niggaz just coming up.       ""Mad props to P. Diddy, Jay-Z, DMX, Lil' Kim, Mystikal, Eve, Ja Rule, Jadakiss, Trick Daddy, and Xzibit. And one love to Meth, RZA, GZA, Ghostface, and the rest of My real niggaz in the Wu-Tang Clan,"" the deity said. ""These My beloved niggaz, with whom I be well-pleased.""       Now nearing the 48-hour mark, the Lord's first-ever reciprocal shout-out shows little sign of slowing down. Based on estimates of the number of rappers who have thanked Him in liner notes over the past 20 years, hip-hop experts say the historic shout-out is likely to continue through early next week.       In addition to rap's current stars, God offered shout-outs to the original hip-hop heads, including such pioneers of the art form as Grandmaster Flash, Busy Bee, Melle Mel, Jazzy Jay, Kool Moe Dee, Afrika Bambaataa, DJ Red Alert, the Cold Crush Brothers, Fab 5 Freddy, Kurtis Blow, Kool Herc, and the Funky 4+1.       God also offered shout-outs to the many DJs, record labels, magazines, TV shows, and radio stations that have tirelessly supported hip-hop over the years. Among them are Def Jam, Tommy Boy, Jive, Roc-A-Fella, Rap Pages, The Source, Right On!, The Box, Funkmaster Flex, Ed Lover and Dr. Dre, WBLS 107.5, KISS-FM, and Hot 97.       ""For supporting the many artists who have supported Me so faithfully, I say thank you,"" God said. ""All praise to Devante Harrell, Wanda Simmons, LaShell Thomas, and everybody else at Uptown/MCA for making this possible.""   <http://graphics.theonion.com/pics_3731/god_gives_shout_out_jump.jpg>	 	 Above: A pair of shout-out tablets handed down by the Lord. 	       As a further sign of His love for the hip-hop community, God assured the nation's rappers that He is taking good care of all their peers currently with Him in heaven.       ""Tupac, Notorious B.I.G., Eazy-E, Scott LaRock-some of y'all niggaz are already up in this bitch,"" the Lord said. ""For those of you who were left behind, know that the Lord has got your dead homies' backs. Faith [Evans], I promise I'm taking real good care of your Biggie. He resting in crazy peace, no doubt.""       Thus far, God has not played favorites, thanking such fallen-off acts as Hammer and Vanilla Ice in the same breath as vital artists whose careers are still going strong. The Lord has also seen fit to thank the little-known likes of Baby Tragic, DJ Phreek Malik, and Da Ill Collector-MCs so obscure that virtually no one within the hip-hop community has heard of them. All rappers, God explained, are equal in His sight, and none are too small to escape His notice.       ""God sees even the smallest sparrow fall,"" said Dr. Cornell West, Harvard University professor of African-American studies and philosophy of religion. ""The same is true of MCs: Whether a major superstar or a complete unknown, all rappers are His children, and He loves them all.""       The sheer volume of names notwithstanding, the nation's rappers are deeply touched by God's gesture of tribute and appreciation, with many stating that they ""feelin' Him.""       ""God is the Original,"" Brooklyn-based rapper Mos Def said. ""The world is ruled by the wealthy and the wicked, but all respect due to the Creator who made this world and who will one day bring justice to the wicked and righteous alike.""       Despite the overwhelmingly positive response among rappers, the Lord is drawing fire in certain circles for His use of the word ""nigga."" On Monday's Larry King Live, conservative activist Rev. Calvin Butts, a longtime ally of the Lord, blasted Him for His ""shocking, unexpected use of the racially loaded N-word."" Some concerned parties, including decency crusader C. Delores Tucker, Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-UT), and members of the San Francisco-based What About The Children? Foundation, are calling for a boycott of church services until God issues an apology.       Reacting to the controversy, many in the hip-hop community are rushing to the Lord's defense.       ""The word 'nigga' means different things depending on how it's used and who's saying it,"" rap legend and Public Enemy frontman Chuck D said. ""Judging from context, God obviously wasn't being derogatory. He was using 'nigga' as a blanket term of affection for all His true supporters on the rap scene. At one point, He said, 'I wanna give a shout-out to Ad-Rock, MC Serch, and my man Dan The Automator-all y'all is real niggaz in My all-benevolent sight.' Considering the fact that Ad-Rock and Serch are Jewish, and the Automator is Asian-American, it's clear God isn't talking about race here. He's just paying respect to all those who have paid respect to Him.""       ""God's the ultimate playa, so naturally He's going to have some haters,"" rapper Ice Cube said. ""But these haters need to realize that if you mess with the man upstairs, you will get your ass smote. True dat.""  <http://www.theonion.com/cgi-bin/email/emailthis.cgi>    <http://adbot.theonion.com/RealMedia/ads/click_cx.cgi/www.theonion.com/topstory///26673/Bottom/default/empty.gif/63303938386330393362326133316630>  ?

As to who is responsible there is almost overwhelming evidence that Osama Bin Laden was heavily involved if not the mastermind and/or financier.  If you are interested -  read the article below that gives a breakdown on who is believed to be responsible. Osama Bin Laden is a terrorist that has targeted American people before (embassy bombings in 1998 and attack on USS Cole in Yemen earlier this year) and it would be in America's best interest to end his reign of terror by ending his life! ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- U.S. focuses on Bin Laden links with Hizbullah, Arafat's Fatah    SPECIAL TO WORLD TRIBUNE.COM Friday, September 14, 2001 WASHINGTON - The United States is investigating whether a coalition of Palestinian, Iranian and Lebanese groups joined to help launch the suicide attacks in New York and Washington. U.S. defense sources said the Pentagon and CIA are quickly coming to the conclusion that Saudi billionaire fugitive Osama Bin Laden was the sponsor of the attack. But they said Bin Laden is believed to have used a range of Islamic groups for logistics and support. The groups being investigated include the Fatah movement headed by Palestinian Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat, the sources said. Another group being examined for a link to the U.S. attacks is the Iranian-backed Hizbullah, Middle East Newsline reports. ""Most of it today points to Osama Bin Laden,"" Sen. Charles Grassley, the ranking Republican on the Senate Finance Committee, said. ""But the speculation at the end of the road is that he and his network were very much involved with Hizbullah, Fatah and other."" Grassley was one of at least two dozen House and Senate members who were briefed by U.S. intelligence agencies since the bombing. A U.S. official confirmed that the administration has not ruled out that Bin Laden was provided aid by a range of Arab and Islamic groups. But the official said no determination has been made. ""We want to be sure we understand all the connections, not just one connection,"" the official said. ""As we find out who actually perpetrated the crime, as we find out who they're connected with, as we find out who could be considered harboring them, I think it'll come clear."" Analysts and some congressional sources said the Bush administration appears unwilling to thoroughly investigate the involvement of Iraq in the U.S. attacks. They said that the administration fears that targeting Iraq would dash hopes for an Arab coalition against terrorism in the Middle East. Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld said the United States has not yet determined who was behind the bombing. Rumsfeld said a determination would have to be made soon. The administration has requested $20 billion for a counterterrorism campaign. Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz said much of the requested allocation would prepare the military for an expected counterattack. ""I don't think we know the breakdown yet, partly because the needs are so enormous,"" Wolfowitz said. ""A significant piece of this is going to be to bring our armed forces to the highest level of preparedness.""  -----Original Message----- From: Frank, Laura [mailto:lfrank@vignette.com] Sent: Friday, September 14, 2001 10:02 AM To: 'Michael Wilkes'; 'Christine Finch'; astephens@crushinteractive.com; dax@cypressmail.com; austinassistant@clausman.com; isaac@prad.net; Frank, Laura; lydter@yahoo.com; jmilbrandt@southwestart.com; muc@earthlink.net; mark.tasseel@netiq.com; mcuilla@enron.com; tina.obanion@gte.net; toddgator@yahoo.com; strangle_2000@yahoo.com; zwharton@dawray.com Subject: RE: New WTC A more mature way to deal with the situation would be to wait until the government proves he is responsible, rather than send hate mail & cause added tension between the two countries!

I have to admit that i wasn't looking forward to it since i didn't know how she was going to act and if she was going to be bitchy.  About 15 minutes after we got there we passed on the way to the betting counter and she pulled me aside and was so very cool.  She kept asking are you o.k. and almost seemed to sympathize with me.  She said she didn't say anything to dax and would never say anything to him.  She was so cool about it i was totally shocked.  So on sunday dax calls and says they are going to bw3 so after a couple of hours we go up there to meet them.  I walk in and missy and don were there so i was a little surprised.    After we had been there for a while Z, laura, devon, and michelle go to play darts leaving me and missy at the table.  So starts saying so you aren't going to email me anymore and acting all sad.  Then she said i didn't have any balls.  Later don is talking about the heisman and what the statue looks like and she looks at me and says i am not giving you the heisman i guess you could say i am giving you the anti-heisman and motions as if to open her legs.  It was funny as shit.  She also said she dumped dale but i don't know that i completely buy that.  Anyway, all together it was very interesting weekend.  I don't know that i could ever trust missy to be discrete so while it is very tempting it is also very dangerous.   -----Original Message----- From: james.h.cook@us.andersen.com [mailto:james.h.cook@us.andersen.com] Sent: Monday, August 27, 2001 7:05 AM To: Cuilla, Martin Subject: Re: Oh shit - what did missy say??

Its trailing P/E is 6.53 and forward P/E is 14 which is still on the low side of historical P/Es (6-60 with average of 30) but it all comes back to how long you think gas prices are in a $2-$3 environment.  Usually when you are as full in storage as we are going to be it takes at least 2 years to work off the extra gas which would lower earnings in 2002 and 2003.  I think the industry is going to wash out in the next month or two and could be off up to 20% and then maybe it will find the bottom.  The one thing I have learned from trading is usually there is a big washout of the longs (like down $3 or more in a day or two for EOG) that takes place before you find the bottom.

Chris Mortensen reported the Raider brass were simply calling it ""Sebastian being Sebastian"".   Coach Jon Gruden joked that he was just ""glad he fell on his head and not his leg"".   Most sort of shrugged it off as ""those crazy Raiders"". But now it's getting a little more serious with this CNNSI article: http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/football/news/2001/10/09/raiders_janikowski _ap/ Janikowski Hurt in Fall After ""Apparent Drug Overdose"" SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Oakland Raiders kicker Sebastian Janikowski fell at a nightclub due to ""an apparent drug overdose,"" cutting his face and requiring five stitches a few hours after the Raiders' game against Dallas, police said Tuesday. Janikowski was taken to a hospital after patrons at the Sno-Drift Bar reported he had collapsed early Monday morning, police spokesman Dewayne Tully said. Janikowski, 23, who attended team meetings later Monday, was not arrested, Tully said. A police report indicated the club's doorman told officers that Janikowski was ""possibly overdosing on GHB"" -- the so-called date-rape drug. Last April in Florida, Janikowski was found innocent on charges of drug possession and evidence tampering after being accused of possessing GHB. In the police report Monday, officers wrote they ""found Janikowski incoherent and wildly flailing around on the floor. As a result of the uncontrolled flailing, Janikowski hit his head on the floor and caused a cut over his right eye."" Janikowski did not respond when officers talked to him, and he was placed in soft restraints on a gurney for the trip to the hospital, the police report said. Janikowski's roommate, Jay Hoffman, told police the kicker was not taking drugs but that he was with an unidentified woman earlier in the night who may have slipped something into his drink. Other witnesses at the club told police they saw Janikowski voluntarily taking what appeared to be GHB earlier in the evening. Paul Healy, the kicker's agent, said Janikowski needed stitches for a head wound. He said his client had been drinking, and said reports of a drug overdose were ""totally false."" ""I know he was out there at a nightclub in San Francisco and slipped and fell. At a lot of these clubs, people spill their drinks, and he slipped and whacked his head,"" Healy said. ""You don't have a drug overdose Sunday night and go to practice Monday morning."" Asked about the police report, Raiders spokesman Mike Taylor said Tuesday the team would have no comment. Raiders coaches said Janikowski appeared fine Monday. The kicker, who has made all eight of his field goals this season, was not in the locker room in the hour that reporters are allowed access on days following games. Janikowski, a native of Poland, was Oakland's first-round choice in the 2000 draft after starring at Florida State. In June 2000, Janikowski was acquitted on a charge he offered a Tallahassee policeman $300 to release his roommate after an argument with a bouncer who wouldn't let him into a local nightclub. His contract includes a clause that will force him to pay back about $25,000 for every game he misses due to suspension. The clause was added because of his run-ins with the law. [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [  OUR VIEW  ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] First thing - nothing has been proven.   It's important to note we're talking about allegations here.   But clearly, this isn't as funny now.   He likely skates here without too much trouble but it's probably a sign that you need a ""plan B"" if Janikowski is your kicker.   Just to be safe.

Starbucks has always charged a premium price for a ""premium product"".  Recently, the quality of the coffee served downstairs has been miserable.  Very often the coffee that they serve is burnt and you can tell just by smelling it.  It tastes horrible and I know it isn't just me because about 5 or 6 people who sit next to me have all had the same conversation about how the coffee is always burnt.  Today, I bought a large coffee and by the time I returned to my desk took the first sip and it was horrible.  I went back to the lobby and told the girl it was burnt and she smelled it and agreed.  Then she gave me a new cup that was supposed to be fresh brewed.  It was just as bad.  It tastes and smells horrible!  Something has to be changed because the quality of the coffee doesn't deserve a price of a $.25 much less over $1.00  subject: Starbucks "

As most of you already know, it has been a crazy weekend for some of us.  I'm going to address why all this happened, what we have done, and the ongoing problems we are having? About 8 months ago Martin Cuilla took a position on a curve called GD-AECOUSD-DAIL.  On Friday he wanted to move this position to another curve called GD-AECOCD/FRWKD.  We had being seeing the position come in on the bench report but apparently VaR was not being captured on it.  It was not in the Primary/Secondary curve mapping table in Risktrac and was not mapped to an intra-month curve either (OMICRON).   On Friday evening I asked Burton to map the new curve in the primary /secondary table and Virendra to map it to OMICRON_9.  If this would have worked we expected Cuillas VaR to fall by approx. $800K given the risk structure of his positions.  But the desired results were not achieved.   On Saturday with the help of Ramesh, Virendra and Burton we tried several different combinations of mappings with no positive results.  The positions do not seem to be coming in as we are not picking up the book in Component Var.  The book should be INTRA-ONTARIO-CAD2.  It exists but, there are no positions in it.   The only reason this would happen if the curve had no Volatilities or Prices associated with it.  We need to find out why this is so?  Understand also that AECOCD/FRWKD is a derived curve so it has no Prices and Vols of it's own but takes it from AECO-CDN/IM.  We have also mapped AECO-CDN/IM to CGPR-AECO/BASIS and to OMICRON_9 but still are not getting any changes.   Ramesh, Burton Virendra, and Bruce have all worked very hard this weekend, despite having other work related commitments, to try to resolve this, and have gone over and above what was expected of them.  But despite all our efforts this is still a problem that needs addressing.   Cuilla is very concerned about this because Lavorato is watching him.  I have to answer to him tomorrow and cannot use systems issues as an excuse.  I want us as a team to look at this tomorrow and in the short-run fix Cuillas VaR.  We also want curve mapping to become a more front-end solution (with very few users) because of their (the front office) knowledge of where the different curves need to be mapped.  Kam Keiser will help us with this. In the long-run I don't want any of us to have to do this again and want to identify a solution.  Ramesh has rightly pointed out that this will take time and resources on his side.  Given the speed of the work in this place none of us have either extra time or resources but, we have to find a way and, most of all be patient while we address these issues. Please understand that tomorrow may be a little hectic for all concerned parties but to be patient while we try to reach the root of the problem.  Nilay we will need your expertise about curve mappings, and OMICRONS, for this?   Thanks again for all your help this weekend....... Regards Bharat subject: FW: Weekend Events......... "

I have to admit that i wasn't looking forward to it since i didn't know how she was going to act and if she was going to be bitchy.  About 15 minutes after we got there we passed on the way to the betting counter and she pulled me aside and was so very cool.  She kept asking are you o.k. and almost seemed to sympathize with me.  She said she didn't say anything to dax and would never say anything to him.  She was so cool about it i was totally shocked.  So on sunday dax calls and says they are going to bw3 so after a couple of hours we go up there to meet them.  I walk in and missy and don were there so i was a little surprised.    After we had been there for a while Z, laura, devon, and michelle go to play darts leaving me and missy at the table.  So starts saying so you aren't going to email me anymore and acting all sad.  Then she said i didn't have any balls.  Later don is talking about the heisman and what the statue looks like and she looks at me and says i am not giving you the heisman i guess you could say i am giving you the anti-heisman and motions as if to open her legs.  It was funny as shit.  She also said she dumped dale but i don't know that i completely buy that.  Anyway, all together it was very interesting weekend.  I don't know that i could ever trust missy to be discrete so while it is very tempting it is also very dangerous.   -----Original Message----- From: james.h.cook@us.andersen.com [mailto:james.h.cook@us.andersen.com] Sent: Monday, August 27, 2001 7:05 AM To: Cuilla, Martin Subject: Re: Oh shit - what did missy say??

Cook@ANDERSEN WO cc: Date: 08/26/2001 10:55 PM From: Martin.Cuilla@enron.com Subject: I don't know if this is going to keep its format but EOG's trailing earning are $5.01 and forward expectations are $2.31 and that probably is too high.  Its trailing P/E is 6.53 and forward P/E is 14 which is still on the low side of historical P/Es (6-60 with average of 30) but it all comes back to how long you think gas prices are in a $2-$3 environment.  Usually when you are as full in storage as we are going to be it takes at least 2 years to work off the extra gas which would lower earnings in 2002 and 2003.  I think the industry is going to wash out in the next month or two and could be off up to 20% and then maybe it will find the bottom.  The one thing I have learned from trading is usually there is a big washout of the longs (like down $3 or more in a day or two for EOG) that takes place before you find the bottom.
