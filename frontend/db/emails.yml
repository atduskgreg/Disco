  body: ! "Amy and Alec are definitely welcome!  Actually we had already planned on
    Amy \nand Alec coming and a couple who we are friends with is bringing their \ndaughter,
    our flower girl, who is about 4 years old.  We have a whole room to \nourselves
    at the restaurant so Amy and Alec should be fine.  I talked to \ngrandma and she
    said Julie wouldn't be able to make it so I already knew \nabout that.  Don't
    worry about having 4 more people, the only reason we were \ncautious about inviting
    aunts and uncles was we didn't want to open up the \nflood gates but most of them
    already live in Houston or aren't going to make \nit to Houston until late Friday.
    \ As far as the bill just let me know what \nyou are comfortable with and we will
    pick up the rest.  The food bill with \ntax and tip will be about $1,350.  We
    are very appreciative to have both our \nparent's help as we quickly found that
    weddings are very expensive.  However, \nwe are both adults with good careers
    and try to be very self-sufficient.  \nAlso, we realize that some things we do
    seem extravagant by our parents \nstandards.  We could have just as easily had
    a rehearsal at a Mexican \nrestaurant and it would have been cheaper - however
    we would rather have \nthings a certain way and pay for the difference.  Also,
    I know that you guys \nare on a tight budget with the building of your house.
    \ The bottom line is \nthat we are grateful for any help we receive and have the
    resources to pay \nthe balance.  Our most  important concern is that all our family
    and friends \nto have a great time.  While I am on the subject, I hope your mother
    and \ngrandma Ina aren't going to get their feeling hurt about people drinking
    wine \nat the dinner.  If you think they will please mention it to them on the
    way \ndown because I don't want them to be offended but I can't change who Zooey
    \nand I are.  Just so you know we will have dinner and desert and then there \nwill
    be several toasts starting with the best man (James Cook) and the matron \nof
    honor (Amber) and then probably ending in Zooey and me doing a quick \ntoast.
    \ We would love for all our family to be there but if grandmother or \nBetty Joyce
    is going to get offended and don't want to stay I understand.  \nAlso, do you
    know if Skipper is planning to attend.  We haven't received a \nreply card as
    to whether he will be there or not.  As to this weekend, I am \ngoing to try to
    stop by but don't have a car so just depends what is going \non.  I will be in
    Dallas so if Mark is coming over Saturday afternoon I could \nget a ride from
    him.  I'll try to talk to him and see if that works.  \nFinally, we are both really
    looking forward to our big day and are very glad \nto have all our family there
    to support us!  If you have any questions please \ncall me tonight at the house.\n\n\n\n\n\nSharon.Cuilla@nlrb.gov

    \    Hi Marty,\n\n     Amy and I were talking over the weekend and she said she
    did not plan\n     to attend the rehearsal dinner because there was no one to
    keep Alec.\n     Would you and Zooey think it was OK if she came and brought Alec
    for\n     dinner only and left as soon as they were through eating?  She said\n
    \    she did not want to ask you about it because she didn't want you or\n     Zooey
    to feel any pressure.  This is your special time and she doesn't\n     want to
    detract from it in any way.  I feel sorry for her missing out.\n     It is hard
    for Alec to be still and quite for very long but I think he\n     would be fine
    while we are eating.  Would you please talk with Zooey\n     and ask her how she
    feels about Amy bringing Alec for a while.  Amy\n     would leave right away if
    Alec was disturbing anyone.  If you prefer\n     he doesn't come, just say so.
    \ There will certainly be no hard\n     feelings over it.\n\n     I spoke with
    Betty Joyce Sunday and Julianna and her husband are not\n     going to be able
    to come.  Joyce, Chester, Renee, and Travis (her\n     boyfriend) are planning
    to arrive in Houston Friday afternoon the\n     29th.  Dad and I are bringing
    Grandma Ina and Mamanet with us and\n     should arrive early in the afternoon
    on Friday.  Mike decided to fly\n     and is coming in Saturday around 4 p.m.
    \ There will be 9 or 11\n     (depending if Amy comes) of us from our family for
    the rehearsal\n     dinner.  I know that is more that you had planned on but I
    will pay\n     for the extra people.  Why don't you call me when you have time
    and we\n     can talk about it.\n\n     Now that Mamanet is coming, she is very
    excited about the trip.  She\n     called me yesterday when she got her ticket
    and she said she had\n     really wanted to come but didn't think she would have
    the chance to\n     come.  I'm glad I was able to work it out.\n\n     Grandma
    Ina will arrive here this week on Thursday.  It seems like I\n     remember you
    and Zooey were going to be in town this weekend for her\n     class reunion.  I
    know you have a busy schedule and may not have time\n     to come by, but if you
    do let me know when and we will plan lunch or\n     whatever.  If you have time
    you can see the new house.  It is looking\n     better every day.\n\n     Love,\n\n

  subject: ! 'Re: Plans'
  body: ! "Amy and Alec are definitely welcome!  Actually we had already planned on
    Amy \nand Alec coming and a couple who we are friends with is bringing their \ndaughter,
    our flower girl, who is about 4 years old.  We have a whole room to \nourselves
    at the restaurant so Amy and Alec should be fine.  I talked to \ngrandma and she
    said Julie wouldn't be able to make it so I already knew \nabout that.  Don't
    worry about having 4 more people, the only reason we were \ncautious about inviting
    aunts and uncles was we didn't want to open up the \nflood gates but most of them
    already live in Houston or aren't going to make \nit to Houston until late Friday.
    \ As far as the bill just let me know what \nyou are comfortable with and we will
    pick up the rest.  The food bill with \ntax and tip will be about $1,350.  We
    are very appreciative to have both our \nparent's help as we quickly found that
    weddings are very expensive.  However, \nwe are both adults with good careers
    and try to be very self-sufficient.  \nAlso, we realize that some things we do
    seem extravagant by our parents \nstandards.  We could have just as easily had
    a rehearsal at a Mexican \nrestaurant and it would have been cheaper - however
    we would rather have \nthings a certain way and pay for the difference.  Also,
    I know that you guys \nare on a tight budget with the building of your house.
    \ The bottom line is \nthat we are grateful for any help we receive and have the
    resources to pay \nthe balance.  Our most  important concern is that all our family
    and friends \nto have a great time.  While I am on the subject, I hope your mother
    and \ngrandma Ina aren't going to get their feeling hurt about people drinking
    wine \nat the dinner.  If you think they will please mention it to them on the
    way \ndown because I don't want them to be offended but I can't change who Zooey
    \nand I are.  Just so you know we will have dinner and desert and then there \nwill
    be several toasts starting with the best man (James Cook) and the matron \nof
    honor (Amber) and then probably ending in Zooey and me doing a quick \ntoast.
    \ We would love for all our family to be there but if grandmother or \nBetty Joyce
    is going to get offended and don't want to stay I understand.  \nAlso, do you
    know if Skipper is planning to attend.  We haven't received a \nreply card as
    to whether he will be there or not.  As to this weekend, I am \ngoing to try to
    stop by but don't have a car so just depends what is going \non.  I will be in
    Dallas so if Mark is coming over Saturday afternoon I could \nget a ride from
    him.  I'll try to talk to him and see if that works.  \nFinally, we are both really
    looking forward to our big day and are very glad \nto have all our family there
    to support us!  If you have any questions please \ncall me tonight at the house.\n\n\n\n\n\nSharon.Cuilla@nlrb.gov

    \    Hi Marty,\n\n     Amy and I were talking over the weekend and she said she
    did not plan\n     to attend the rehearsal dinner because there was no one to
    keep Alec.\n     Would you and Zooey think it was OK if she came and brought Alec
    for\n     dinner only and left as soon as they were through eating?  She said\n
    \    she did not want to ask you about it because she didn't want you or\n     Zooey
    to feel any pressure.  This is your special time and she doesn't\n     want to
    detract from it in any way.  I feel sorry for her missing out.\n     It is hard
    for Alec to be still and quite for very long but I think he\n     would be fine
    while we are eating.  Would you please talk with Zooey\n     and ask her how she
    feels about Amy bringing Alec for a while.  Amy\n     would leave right away if
    Alec was disturbing anyone.  If you prefer\n     he doesn't come, just say so.
    \ There will certainly be no hard\n     feelings over it.\n\n     I spoke with
    Betty Joyce Sunday and Julianna and her husband are not\n     going to be able
    to come.  Joyce, Chester, Renee, and Travis (her\n     boyfriend) are planning
    to arrive in Houston Friday afternoon the\n     29th.  Dad and I are bringing
    Grandma Ina and Mamanet with us and\n     should arrive early in the afternoon
    on Friday.  Mike decided to fly\n     and is coming in Saturday around 4 p.m.
    \ There will be 9 or 11\n     (depending if Amy comes) of us from our family for
    the rehearsal\n     dinner.  I know that is more that you had planned on but I
    will pay\n     for the extra people.  Why don't you call me when you have time
    and we\n     can talk about it.\n\n     Now that Mamanet is coming, she is very
    excited about the trip.  She\n     called me yesterday when she got her ticket
    and she said she had\n     really wanted to come but didn't think she would have
    the chance to\n     come.  I'm glad I was able to work it out.\n\n     Grandma
    Ina will arrive here this week on Thursday.  It seems like I\n     remember you
    and Zooey were going to be in town this weekend for her\n     class reunion.  I
    know you have a busy schedule and may not have time\n     to come by, but if you
    do let me know when and we will plan lunch or\n     whatever.  If you have time
    you can see the new house.  It is looking\n     better every day.\n\n     Love,\n\n
    \    Mom\n\n"

  subject: California on the Brink -- CERA Alert
  body: ! "CERA Alert: Dcember 13, 2000 \n\nTitle: California on the Brink \nCERA
    Knowledge Areas: Western Energy, N. American Power, N. American Gas \n\nCALIFORNIA
    ON THE BRINK \nThe California Stalemate \nCalifornia moved closer to the brink
    of an outage today as concerns over \ncredit-worthiness of buyers brought the
    possibility that generators would \navoid selling to the California market. While
    numerous factors have \ncontributed to the high cost of power incurred by California's
    utilities, the \nroot cause of the current crisis is a lack of new generation.
    The current \ncredit crisis and its threat to supplies could spark state action
    to address \nthe situation. The collective efforts of all market participants
    should be \nfocused on increasing generation capacity as quickly as possible.\n\nWestern
    power prices have skyrocketed well beyond the record levels set this \nsummer.
    Perhaps because frozen rates insulate the majority of California \nconsumers and
    companies from tangible effects of the market crisis, \nregulators have been able
    to postpone meaningful market reforms and \nsignificant rate increases. The California
    Public Utilities Commission denied \nthe requests of Pacific Gas & Electric and
    Southern California Edison to end \ntheir rate freezes, forcing these utilities
    at least temporarily to finance \nthe costs of higher wholesale energy. This has
    created an unsustainable \naccumulation of costs and a loss of faith in the California
    market. \n\nThe current credit crisis and the potential for blackouts may become
    the \ngalvanizing events that provide state regulators with a public mandate to
    \naddress the underlying structural problems in the industry. However, there is
    \nno guarantee that these regulatory actions will expedite an effective \nsolution
    for customers and the industry as a whole. Wholesale and retail \nmarkets that
    emerge from regulatory intervention are likely to remain \nmuddled. In the necessarily
    political process that will follow, it is \npossible that-as has largely been
    the case so far-the steps taken will fail \nto move the California power market
    toward a more enduring solution and will \ninstead continue to mask the underlying
    structural flaws. \n\nIn the six months since California's supply shortfall began
    plaguing Western \nmarkets, regulators have done little to address the underlying
    problem. \nRather than addressing the cause of the supply shortage-establishing
    a market \nenvironment that encourages timely additions of new generating capacity
    and \ndemand side responses-efforts are instead directed at trying to lay blame
    for \nthe crisis and lessen the immediate financial impact on customers. Indeed,
    \nseveral actions taken thus far have served more to compound the problem by \ndiscouraging
    new power plant additions. These include price caps, repeated \nchanges to market
    rules, attempts to seize generator profits, and a \nchallenging siting and permitting
    process.\n\nMedicine Worse than the Illness \nSeveral years of electricity demand
    growth and low prices in California were \naccompanied by very few additions to
    the supply base. Regulators did not pay \nadequate attention to the looming supply
    shortfall. The void of consensus \nover the cause of the current crisis has instead
    been replaced by a series of \nbandaid remedies that address the symptoms, but
    not the cause, of \nCalifornia's electric market woes.* \n\n* Challenging siting
    and permitting. Despite state action to better \ncoordinate the siting and permitting
    process for new power plants, power \nplant developers still face high hurdles.
    Local community opposition alone \nhas struck down some key proposed facilities.\n\n*
    Price caps discourage investment. State and federal proposals to cap prices \nlimit
    the attractiveness of the California wholesale power market, especially \nfor
    developers who have the option of channeling scarce capital and equipment \nto
    more stable or more attractive markets outside the state. \n\n* Repeated rule
    changes. Frequent rule changes in the ISO markets (including \nthe price caps)
    confound attempts by developers to estimate profits from new \nplant development.\n\n*
    Calls for refunds. Despite reports by the Power Exchange, the ISO, and the \nFERC
    that no pattern of abuse could be found from their examination of the \nCalifornia
    markets, state officials continue to accuse power providers of \ngaming the market.
    Calls by state officials for refunds of generator profits \nare a threat to new
    plant development.\n\n* Facility inspections. Recent inspections of power plants
    by state officials \nto verify that operators are honestly reporting the operational
    status of \ntheir generating units accentuates the atmosphere of mistrust.\n\nCERA's
    recent analysis suggests that merchant plant developers in the West \nare not
    guaranteed? to make a profit. Prospects of new plant profitability \nare affected
    by the timing and quantity of new plants, decommissioning of \nolder units, demand
    growth, and numerous other difficult-to-forecast factors. \nCalifornia's regulatory
    actions only further cloud the assessment of \nfinancial viability and degrade
    the political environment for developers \nconsidering entering the state. \n\nDespite
    efforts by the California ISO to stimulate new capacity additions in \nthe state
    with a special, limited-term capacity payment, CERA estimates that \ndemand growth
    will continue to outstrip supply additions in the West in 2001. \nIn addition,
    the existing siting and permitting process will prevent a \nsufficient quantity
    of capacity from entering the market until 2003 at the \nearliest. Therefore,
    three years remain before a sufficient quantity of \ncapacity enters service to
    significantly dampen prices and decrease the risk \nof an outage. \n\nThe Road
    to Recovery \nThere are a number of actions that can be taken to help relieve
    the capacity \nshortfall: \n\n* Encourage new build. Supply must be part of the
    answer. This requires a \nseries of steps that can help facilitate new supply
    build. While in principal \nsome have been taken, such as new fast track approval,
    the success of these \nactions can only be measured by the build itself. For now,
    there is still not \nenough new supply coming on until 2003 to relieve supply
    tightness.? \n\n* Stabilize investment climate. Utilities must have assurance
    that they will \nultimately be allowed to recover market costs for power. This
    provides the \ncredit worthiness needed by sellers to produce energy and to stimulate
    new \nbuild.\n\n* Move toward more balanced utility supply portfolios. One of
    the reasons the \npressure on customers has been so intense in California has
    been the absence \n(and even discouragement) of diverse supply portfolios among
    the utilities in \nthe state-particularly for residential and small commercial
    customers. With \nthe market at a peak, however, now is in one sense a sub-optimal
    time to move \ntoward term contracting. Yet these contracts provide the foundation
    for a \nseries of actions-including new supply build and demand side investments.
    If \nthey end up above market, they will at least have achieved the desired effect
    \nof knocking down prices, a fact which by itself should provide sufficient \njustification
    for recovering the cost of these commitments.\n\n* Encourage market mechanisms
    that elicit a demand response. Although \noriginally a feature of California's
    market design, most consumers are \ninsulated from price spikes through capped
    or frozen retail rates. Exposing \ncustomers to at least some of the market price
    signals would encourage a \ndemand response.\n\n* Encourage market mechanisms
    that dampen the \"Boom Bust\" characteristic of \nthe market. Whether in the form
    of a capacity payment, a reserve requirement, \nor a minimum term portfolio requirement,
    the California power market needs to \nmove to a structure that encourages investment
    in new capacity when the \nmarket is in balance rather than waiting for a shortage
    and price shock to \nelicit new investment. Such a structure can help dampen (but
    not eliminate) \nfuture price volatility.\n\n* Avoid continuously tinkering with
    the market. While the market does need to \nbe restructured as described above,
    it also needs to be stable and reliable \nto encourage the development of new
    supply as well as a robust long-term \ncontractual market for power in California.
    Continually tinkering with the \nmarket structure-such as the three times the
    price cap has been shifted since \nJuly-only serves to undermine confidence in
    the market. California needs to \ndo its best to develop a long-term solution
    and then let the market run its \ncourse. \n\n* Allow for greater environmental
    flexibility. The state should explore a \nmore balanced solution to emissions
    restrictions in the face of a supply \nshortfall that has been exacerbated by
    generators that cannot operate due to \nemissions restrictions. \n\n* Free PURPA
    power plants to generate. Relief should be granted to PURPA \npower plants that
    are operational, but are restricted by contract from \noperating to generate only
    power. \n\n**end** \n\nThis CERA Alert will be available in PDF format within

    Dec 12\nTime: 3:00 and 4:00\nLocation: EB 572\n\nPlease stop by to learn more
    about the system or just get a demo of what it \ncan do for you!!!\n\n\nOverview\n\nEnTelligence
    is a web-based prospecting tool designed to deliver market \ninformation on existing
    and potential customers to commercial trading, \nmid-marketing, and origination
    teams.  It also delivers management reports to \nanalyze Enron\x01,s position
    within the key industries that we serve.  Presently, \ncommercial groups have
    multiple methods for acquiring potential customer \ninformation.  This system
    will standardize their resource tools and add \nconsistency to their prospecting
    processes.  EnTelligence combines \ninformation from internal databases such as
    Global Counterparty, Credit \nAggregation System (CAS), Sitara, and ERMS with
    information from external \ndata sources such as Dun & Bradstreet and I.H.S Energy
    Reporter to identify \ncustomer prospects.  By providing the capability to filter
    and search by \nregion, industry, company size, or energy consumption levels,
    the prospecting \nprocess is shortened and the identification of strong prospects
    improved. \nAvailable reports include Market Penetration, Industry Prospecting,
    \nComparison Prospecting, Company Profiles, Family Tree, Top Customers, and \nInactive
    Accounts.  Soon to come is the Activity Details report in mid \nJanuary.  Currently
    only Natural Gas and Power physical deals are loaded, but \nfinancial deals will
    be included in mid January, and new products are soon to \nfollow.  Please submit
    a request for access through eRequest and then log on \nat http://entelligence.enron.com.\n\n\n"

    get these discussions kicked off on your side while he \nwas\nout-of-town today.
    \ Basically, I started off with your proposed procedures \nand made\na few changes
    that Enron needs to make sure that right amount of gas shows up \nat the\ncorrect
    time.\n\nAlso, we are suggesting a confirmation form be sent back and forth between
    \nEnron and\nSithe every day.  This will help document all the small little details
    and \ncosts so that we\nboth drop anything through the cracks.  I am suggesting
    that we e-mail this \nconfirm form\nto the right folks in both our companies,
    so that no one is left out of the \nloop.\n\nYou will also notice our attempt
    to make sure that everyone has a clear \nunderstanding\nof exactly what is included
    in the numbers that are reported to Enron's \ntraders.  The timing\nof your calls
    will be when everyone is very busy in our trading group.  There \nwill not be
    much\ntime to have long conversations, but it is very important that everyone
    have \nthe same\nunderstanding what the numbers mean.\n\nPlease take a look at
    this on your side and see if there are some other \nthings that need to\nbe included.\n\nThanks,\n\nRuth\n\n\n"

  body: ! ' FYI - I just recently paid for a portion of our At&T bill with the

    rest of the free money in our Waterhouse account (wrote a check in the

    amount of like $2200).  The remaining balance is something like $2,500.  All

    of that amount is allocated to our monthly savings for property/school

    taxes.  I guess what you''re saying is you would like to borrow from this

    savings account to make this investment.  As long as you feel confident that

    we will be able to reimburse that amount somehow to pay our taxes (should we

    not get a return on the investment), then I guess we should go for it if

    it''s something you''re excited about and believe is a good investment.

    Naturally, I would prefer we only invest $500 because of the risk involved

    and Christmas just around the corner, but you''re the one with the financial

    instincts and know-how.  Wifey

    Hey how much of the money in our Waterhouse account is budgeted for

    expenses.  I am thinking that it would be a good investment (speculative in

    nature though) to purchase some options on Enron.  The options would expire

    in January and the potential return could vary between a loss of 100% of

    the investment to a 400%-500% return.  I think between a $500-$1,000

    investment would be wise given the nature of it.

    October 14, 2001 7:10 PM\nTo:\tRamesh, Ganapathy; Patel, Virendra; Mills, Bruce;
    McIntyre, Burton; Hayden, Frank; Abel, Chris; Basu, Nilay; Victorio, Tom; Keiser,
    Kam; Jia, Winston\nSubject:\tWeekend Events.........\n\nAs most of you already
    know, it has been a crazy weekend for some of us.  I'm going to address why all
    this happened, what we have done, and the ongoing problems we are having?\n\nAbout
    8 months ago Martin Cuilla took a position on a curve called GD-AECOUSD-DAIL.
    \ On Friday he wanted to move this position to another curve called GD-AECOCD/FRWKD.
    \ We had being seeing the position come in on the bench report but apparently
    VaR was not being captured on it.  It was not in the Primary/Secondary curve mapping
    table in Risktrac and was not mapped to an intra-month curve either (OMICRON).
    \ \n\nOn Friday evening I asked Burton to map the new curve in the primary /secondary
    table and Virendra to map it to OMICRON_9.  If this would have worked we expected
    Cuillas VaR to fall by approx. $800K given the risk structure of his positions.
    \ But the desired results were not achieved.  \n\nOn Saturday with the help of
    Ramesh, Virendra and Burton we tried several different combinations of mappings
    with no positive results.  The positions do not seem to be coming in as we are
    not picking up the book in Component Var.  The book should be INTRA-ONTARIO-CAD2.
    \ It exists but, there are no positions in it.  \n\nThe only reason this would
    happen if the curve had no Volatilities or Prices associated with it.  We need
    to find out why this is so?  Understand also that AECOCD/FRWKD is a derived curve
    so it has no Prices and Vols of it's own but takes it from AECO-CDN/IM.  We have
    also mapped AECO-CDN/IM to CGPR-AECO/BASIS and to OMICRON_9 but still are not
    getting any changes.  \n\nRamesh, Burton Virendra, and Bruce have all worked very
    hard this weekend, despite having other work related commitments, to try to resolve
    this, and have gone over and above what was expected of them.  But despite all
    our efforts this is still a problem that needs addressing.  \n\nCuilla is very
    concerned about this because Lavorato is watching him.  I have to answer to him
    tomorrow and cannot use systems issues as an excuse.  I want us as a team to look
    at this tomorrow and in the short-run fix Cuillas VaR.  We also want curve mapping
    to become a more front-end solution (with very few users) because of their (the
    front office) knowledge of where the different curves need to be mapped.  Kam
    Keiser will help us with this.\n\nIn the long-run I don't want any of us to have
    to do this again and want to identify a solution.  Ramesh has rightly pointed
    out that this will take time and resources on his side.  Given the speed of the
    work in this place none of us have either extra time or resources but, we have
    to find a way and, most of all be patient while we address these issues.\n\nPlease
    understand that tomorrow may be a little hectic for all concerned parties but
    to be patient while we try to reach the root of the problem.  Nilay we will need
    your expertise about curve mappings, and OMICRONS, for this?  \n\nThanks again
    for all your help this weekend.......\n\nRegards\n\nBharat\n\n\n"

  subject: THURSDAY NIGHT ITS SEB FOUNTAINE @ HYPERIA
  body: ! "THURSDAY OCT 25th \n\nSEB FONTAINE \n\nGLOBAL UNDERGROUND = PROTOTYPE-
    CD Release Tour \n\nSeb Fontaine has rescheduled his appearance at HYPERIA. This
    October, 25th, the global domination of this heavily demanded DJ Stops in Houston
    at Hyperia! Seb has dance music in his blood from the day he was conceived in
    Ibiza - his mother is a semi-professional DJ. Growing up in West London, Seb?s
    initial musical development was stimulated by ska, but soon dropped out of sixth
    form college to pursue a career as a DJ. His first ?proper? gig was at Crazy Larry?s
    on the Kings Road, getting paid ?30 a night to spin tunes for a typical Eighties
    ?sloanie? crew. By 1989, Seb landed a residency at The Fridge, Brixton, where
    he played mainly hip hop and rare groove, swiftly followed a year later by a residency
    at The Wag, playing ragga, rare groove and acid. Next came a residency at Subterania,
    alongside Norman Jay and Jeremy Healy. In 1993, Seb gained his first house residency
    at Glitterati at The Cross. Malibu Stacey was the next stop for Seb - a night
    he put together and promoted at the Hanover Grand with friend Craig Richards.
    As Malibu got more established, Seb got increasingly restless, and took to the
    road in a big way, focusing more and more outside of London, becoming one of the
    UK?s hardest working ?motorway jocks?. At the same time, music becomes harder
    and deeper. In 1998, Seb was offerred a fortnightly residency at Cream, which
    soon became a weekly gig. In 1999, Seb took Ibiza by storm, with Cream at Amnesia.
    Seb Fontaine clinched the deal with Radio 1 in February 2000, initially to deputise
    for dance shows exclusively on Radio 1, gaining him the nickname ?super-sub?.
    He also joins Radio 1 in its mammoth summer of live music at the major dance festivals,
    and at the station?s own Radio 1 Dance Parties. \n\n_______________________________________________________________________\nPowered

    Nevada Legalizes Internet Gambling - Maybe

    Many Nevada casinos have decided that Internet gaming is not just going

    to go away. As with Indian gaming, they have abandoned years of wishful

    thinking, arguing for prohibition, and have finally adopted the position

    that the industry should be regulated. So, in June 2001 they persuaded

    the Nevada Legislature and Gov. Kenny Guinn to enact a law legalizing

    online casinos.

    Hi Folks,


    If you''re like me, (and I know many of you are) this game can take on a life

    and death seriousness.   The topsy turvy season may be good for Neilson

    Ratings but not so good for your blood pressure.   Sometimes, the best thing

    to do is laugh a little.   With that said, I''m forwarding a column I found

    entertaining from one of our favorite Sportswriters, Bill Simmons of

    ESPN.com


    I do this every so often.   And I always get a bunch of email yelling about

    "I didn''t sign up for this" and to "keep it serious and on Football".   Save

    your breath.   Unsubscribe instructions are at the bottom of this email.


    Let''s jump to Mr. Simmons.   You can find the original article here

    http://espn.go.com/page2/s/simmons/011023.html


    Lighten Up,


    Joe

    Whazzup with the NFL?


    By Bill Simmons, ESPN.com


    With apologies to CNNSI''s Peter King, here are 10 things I think I think

    after six weeks of the NFL season:



    1. I think this has been the strangest NFL season in recent memory. The

    media usually starts their "This has been the strangest season ever!" buzz

    around Week 5 or Week 6 -- it''s an NFL October Tradition, right up there

    with my girlfriend asking on Sunday at noon if I want to go apple-picking,

    me following that question up with the answer, "What are you, insane?" and

    her storming out of the house -- but this season really has been the

    strangest season of all-time.


    Consider the following things:


    Twenty of the 31 NFL teams have records of .500 or better.


    The short list of quality teams this season includes Chicago, San Diego and

    San Francisco (combined record last season: 12-36).


    Out of the nine consensus Super Bowl "contenders" from the preseason, only

    three of them (Green Bay, St. Louis and Philadelphia) have winning records.

    The other six (Indy, Tampa, Baltimore, Tennessee, Denver and the Giants) are

    a combined 15-18.


    After the favorites went 35-21 against the spread in the first four weeks,

    the underdogs went 22-4-2 over the next two weeks. (22-4-2! That''s

    impossible!)


    The Patriots are slightly above-average as a football team, maybe even a

    little better when you factor in their coaching staff and team chemistry ...

    and there isn''t an NFL team they couldn''t beat if they played well and get

    two or three breaks. No 2001 victory is out of their grasp. Seriously. And

    just for the record, I feel the same way about the Browns and Falcons.


    Along those same lines, other than St. Louis, there isn''t a reliable

    favorite in the league anymore. Remember the days when you could count on a

    contender to bounce back from an embarrassing defeat the following week?

    (What happened to Denver and Baltimore last week? Didn''t they get the memo?)

    Remember the days when you could throw two quality home teams into a

    two-team tease and assume they would cover at home (like Tampa, New Orleans

    and Indianapolis, for instance)? Remember the days when the home team was

    money on Monday nights (like this week with the Giants)? I miss those days.

    And so does my wallet.


    So what''s left? I''m not sure. We already achieved Pete Rozelle''s vision of
    a

    parity-driven NFL two seasons ago, when the 200-to-1 underdog Rams cruised

    to a Super Bowl title. Now we''ve reached a point where the league has become

    predictably unpredictable. It''s a gambler''s worst nightmare.


    (Which reminds me...)



    2. I think the local weatherman in hell will report "Temperatures in the

    midteens all weekend" before I wager on a team that prominently features Jon

    Kitna again.


    2a. I think that there''s excruciating, there''s really excruciating ... and

    then there''s the experience of watching Carolina''s Chris Weinke throwing two

    interceptions inside the 10-yard-line in the first half against a brutal

    Redskins team, then singlehandedly giving the ''Skins life with 10 minutes

    remaining in a 14-0 game (by tossing a screen pass right to LaVar Arrington

    for a 67-yard interception and touchdown). Can everyone who wagered on the

    Panthers last Sunday file a class-action suit against Weinke? Has this ever

    been done before?


    2b. I think the lesson here, as always, is "Never wager on a team with a

    crappy QB." And I knew this! I knew this. Normally I''d fine myself, but the

    financial bloodbath has already been devastating enough. Does anyone know a

    good pawn shop in the Boston area?


    (Whoops... I''m using my out-loud voice again...)


    2c. I think I miss the days when you could recoup your 1 p.m. gambling

    losses by wagering on two sturdy 4 p.m. teams in "Message Game" situations.

    For instance, Sunday featured Denver coming off an embarrassing loss in

    Seattle (and heading into San Diego for an AFC West tilt), as well as the

    Packers looking to drive a stake in Minnesota''s season and extend their lead

    in the NFC Central. In the old days, you could rely on the Mike Shanahans

    and Brett Favres of the world to save your butt. Not anymore.


    As I told my buddy J-Bug last night, "This has become a league which I am

    unfamiliar with." All of the gambling rules accrued over the years ... you

    might as well throw them out the window. I give up.



    3. I think I always get excited for those Coors Light commercials with Barry

    Sanders for one reason: Sanders possesses the strangest hairline of anyone

    on the planet. And just for the record, that includes Shane Battier, Roy

    Firestone, Elton John and Brad Daugherty.


    (Note: Somebody needs to release the Barry Sanders Wig for Halloween this

    month, along with the Dave Campo Wig, the Troy Aikman Concussion Mask, the

    Dave Wannstedt Fake Mustache, the Al Groh Blow-Up Doll and the Fred Taylor

    "Pull Your Own Groin" Start-Up Kit. I''m telling you, NFL Collectibles should

    have a whole Halloween Department. It''s a no-brainer. They could even

    release an "NFL Legends," collection so we could finally get our hands on

    the Bruce Coslet Wig. Can somebody make this happen, please?)



    4. I think it took 16 frustrating years, but Doug Flutie finally found the

    right NFL team. It''s funny how life works out -- had the Bills decided to

    keep him over Rob Johnson, Flutie would have spent his twilight years on a

    rebuilding team. Instead, he''s the proverbial "Right Guy, Right Place, Right

    Time," on a team where he doesn''t have to carry the offensive load -- unless

    it''s absolutely necessary (like Sunday, when Denver stacked the line against

    the sublime LaDainian Tomlinson, putting the game in Flutie''s hands).


    4a. I think Tampa Bay made an enormous mistake going for Brad Johnson over

    Flutie ... and I think it probably costs Tony Dungy his job within the next

    one to four months.


    4b. I think it''s fair to say that the list of "Reliable Quarterbacks Who Can

    Consistently Win Games" has been whittled down to four: Brett Favre, Kurt

    Warner, Jeff Garcia and Flutie. That''s it. That''s the list.


    Think about it. Daunte Culpepper and Donovan McNabb make too many mistakes.

    Brian Griese, Rich Gannon and Mark Brunell are only as good as the people

    around them. Peyton Manning is slapping together a Karl Malone-type career

    (and his Ewing Theory potential is jumping off the charts). Steve McNair and

    Chris Chandler can''t stay healthy. Drew Bledsoe has been hideously exposed

    by Tom Brady (more on this in a second).


    Look at the list again: Favre, Warner, Flutie and Garcia. Three of those

    four guys were forced to prove themselves in other professional leagues

    before another NFL team even gave them a chance.


    (I ask you again ... is this a weird NFL season or what?)



    5. I think we''ve reached the section of the "10 Things" column where I''m

    supposed to talk about non-sports items, like high school field hockey and

    Starbucks.


    (Racking my brain ...)


    (All right ...)


    I''m ashamed to admit this, but Monday night I went to see the new Drew

    Barrymore movie "Riding in Cars with Boys," accompanying the Sports Gal as p

    art of our "She won''t bitch about the fact that I spend seven hours every

    Sunday watching football if I escort her to an occasional chick flick and

    don''t bitch about it" deal. Savvy, huh?


    I only have two hopes with chick flicks: that they''re short and that there''s

    a cute actress prominently involved. Needless to say, since "Riding in Cars"

    lasted for 140 interminable minutes and the wheels came off the "Drew

    Barrymore is a babe" bandwagon about three years ago, I spent the last 45

    minutes trying to pull a piece of metal off the bottom of my seat so I could

    jam it into my jugular vein. Even the Sports Gal didn''t like the movie that

    much, and this is coming from a person who was peeved that the Academy Award

    committee snubbed "The Wedding Planner" last spring.


    Five disturbing phenomenons about the chick flick:


    Every chick flick has a scene where either A) a male baby pees on somebody,

    B) there''s a wedding, and/or C) there''s an unredeeming male character who

    lets somebody down. This is apparently a rule. If you can work all three of

    those scenes in the same movie, the director apparently gets a $50,000

    bonus.


    Whenever I see a chick flick, there''s always a moment when I accidentally

    make eye contact with another boyfriend or spouse at the theater and we

    quickly glance away. It''s like seeing somebody in the adult section of a

    video store -- you''re just hoping nobody will recognize you and things will

    move along as quickly as possible.


    I''ll sum up the storyline from every chick flick: "Men suck."


    There''s always a specific threesome sitting somewhere in the theater during

    every chick flick -- one girl sitting between two guys. Why two? I have no

    idea. Usually, they seem like platonic friends, the girl isn''t very

    attractive, at least one of the guys looks like Tim Burton, and the guys

    overlaugh at every joke in the movie, to the point that you start rooting

    for one of them to choke to death on a Sour Patch Kid. Again, I''m not sure

    what''s going on here.


    Every time you block out the fact that you''re watching a chick flick,

    something funny happens and everyone in the theater starts laughing, a

    high-pitched cacophony of giggles that reminds you, "Hey, I''m at a chick

    flick." That''s usually when I start bludgeoning myself over the head with my

    128-ounce Mountain Dew.


    Anyway, on a scale of 1 to 10, I''d give "Riding Cars with Boys" a minus-13.

    Let''s forget this section ever happened ... and if you''re attending any

    showings of "Serendipity" in the Boston area over the next few weeks and see

    someone who looks like me, please don''t make eye contact with that person.

    For everyone''s sake.



    6. I think the Tom Brady Era is taking the Ewing Theory to the next level,

    especially considering that your buddy Sports Guy predicted a

    Ewing-resurgence for the Patriots before Week 3. You had the overhyped,

    overvalued superstar who never really won anything and received an

    inordinate amount of media attention and fan hype (Drew Bledsoe). You had

    the requisite injury during the season that caused everyone to write the

    team off (Bledsoe going down in Week 2, possibly for the season). You had

    everyone writing the team off.


    And then ...


    You had the team immediately running off a 3-1 streak, including two "I

    can''t believe this is happening!" wins (both over Indy), as well as an

    improbable comeback win (over San Diego), showing more life than they''ve

    shown in years. Now you have the local media searching for answers to

    explain how a team can lose its franchise player and "inexplicably" start

    playing better. And everyone keeps saying that the Patriots have come out of

    nowhere. You know better.


    Just for the record, I officially abandoned my seat on the Bledsoe Bandwagon

    at 2:30 on Sunday afternoon, when the Pats took a 28-6 lead in Indianapolis,

    and I called my father just to pretend I was Paul Tagliabue, announcing,

    "With the first pick of the 2002 expansion draft, the Houston Texans select

    ... Drew Bledsoe, quarterback, New England Patriots."


    (Sounds far-fetched? Remember, they signed Bledsoe to a mammoth contract

    extension last spring; they couldn''t trade him without absorbing an

    impossible salary cap hit. But according to NFL rules, any player who gets

    selected in the expansion draft has his contract and cap figure transferred

    to the Texans -- even the pro-rated bonus payments -- which means the Pats

    could leave Bledsoe unprotected and hope the Texans gobble him up, which

    would clear $10 million to $12 million in cap space to spend in free agents

    next spring. Mmmmmm ... cap space ...)



    7. I think Tampa Bay and Indianapolis should trade coaches -- Dungy

    straight-up for Jim Mora. Why don''t teams ever trade coaches in sports?

    What''s the worst thing that could happen? What about Marty Schottenheimer

    and two Schottenheimers to be named later for George Seifert and cash?

    Couldn''t this work or am I crazy?



    8. I think Buffalo''s Travis Henry always looks like one of those stubborn

    buffaloes on the Discovery Channel that fight off four or five cheetahs

    before they finally get dragged down. Last week against the Jaguars, he had

    57 carries for 65 yards even though he was hit three yards behind the line

    by four defenders on every carry. High comedy. His career might not last

    until November at this rate.



    9. I think Chicago and Pittsburgh are shaping up as the "Out of Nowhere

    Teams" in each conference this season -- those basement teams that beef up

    against crappy opponents, shock the experts, win 10-11 games and scare the

    heck out of the bookmakers in Vegas (given that they were long shots to win

    it all before the season). Both teams run the ball effectively, avoid taking

    chances on offense, swarm the ball on defense and make plays on special

    teams; in other words, they''re following Baltimore''s 2000 playbook to a tee.


    Chicago''s resurgence wasn''t that improbable, given that somebody strange was

    coming out of the NFC Central ... but Pittsburgh? Did you ever envision them

    at 4-1, when four of their first five were on the road? Now they finish up

    with seven of their last 11 at home. Yikes. It''s almost enough to make you

    forget that Kordell Stewart''s still involved. Almost.


    Keep in mind, just in case the Bears or Steelers stumble over the next few

    weeks, there are an inordinate amount of other "Out of Nowhere" candidates:

    San Fran (4-1), San Diego (4-2), Cleveland (4-2), Atlanta (3-3) and New

    England (3-3). For all we know, all of those teams might make the playoffs

    this season ... but the schedule seems to favor Chicago and Pittsburgh over

    everyone else. For all we know, all of those teams might sneak into the

    playoffs. It''s been that kind of season.


    10. I think that "Any Given Sunday" was a flawed movie, to say the least,

    crippled by brutal editing, suicidal casting decisions and a script that

    meandered all over the place. And yet one scene makes it all worth it. You

    know the one. It''s the scene when Al Pacino (as coach Tony DeMarco) throws

    the movie on his back before the Big Game:


    "You know, when you get old in life, things get taken from you. That''s part

    of life. But you only learn that when you start losing stuff. You find out

    that life''s a game of inches. So is football. Because in either game, life

    or football, the margin for error is so small. I mean, one half a step too

    late, or too early, and you don''t quite make it. One half-second too slow or

    too fast, you don''t quite catch it. The inches we need are everywhere around

    us. They''re in every break of the game, every minute, every second."


    (Now the players are clapping ...)


    "On this team, we fight for that inch. On this team, we tear ourselves and

    everyone around us for that inch. We claw with our fingernails for that

    inch. Because we know that when we add up all those inches, we know that''s

    gonna make the #$%#@& difference between winning and losing! Between living?and
    dying!"??(Now the players are screaming along with every word...)??"I''ll tell
    you this -- in any fight, it''s the guy who''s willing to die who''s?gonna win
    that inch ... Now I can''t make you do it. You gotta look at the?guy next to ya,
    look into his eyes, and I think you''re gonna see a guy who?will go that inch
    with you."??(The light bulb finally clicks for enigmatic QB Willie Beamon ...
    he strolls?toward his coach, inspired ...)??"You''re gonna see a guy who will
    sacrifice himself for this team because he?knows when it comes down to it, you''re
    gonna do the same for him. That''s a?team, gentleman. And either we heal, now,
    as a team ... or we will die as?individuals. That''s football, guys. That''s all
    it is."??(Dramatic pause)??"Now, what are you gonna do?"??(Complete Pandemonium
    in the locker room. Chills galore. And the team bursts?out of the locker room
    in slow motion ...)??And I can''t think of a better way to end this column.???/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/???Back

  body: ! "Hi Folks,\n\nChapter 23 of the never ending saga...\n\nJoe\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\nBroncos
    Don't Trade Gary Due to Health of Davis\n\nEntire story:\nhttp://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/football/news/2001/10/23/ravens_broncos_ap/\n\nClipped
    from the Don Banks article:\n\nAs has become the norm, the NFL trading deadline
    passed Tuesday without a\nmove. But a headline deal that would have sent Denver
    running back Olandis\nGary to the defending Super Bowl champion Ravens nearly
    came to fruition\nMonday, according to sources within the Baltimore organization.\n\nThe
    Ravens senior vice president of football operations Ozzie Newsome and\nBroncos
    general manager Neal Dahlen spoke several times Monday and had in\nplace the framework
    of a trade that would have sent Gary and a fourth-round\npick in 2002 to the Ravens
    for reserve defensive tackle Lionel Dalton and\nBaltimore's second-round selection
    next year.\n\nBut the deal-breaker, according to Ravens sources, was the ever-confusing\nissue
    of Terrell Davis' health. Ravens officials believe their deal with\nDenver was
    alive until late in the afternoon, when Broncos head coach Mike\nShanahan became
    convinced that he could not count on Davis to return to\nhealth this year, even
    as a backup to starter Mike Anderson.\n\nIt is believed that Davis himself on
    Monday may have nixed the trade of Gary\nby informing Shanahan that he is uncertain
    when he will be able to play\nagain. Davis has been out since requiring arthroscopic
    surgery on his\ntroubled right knee following Denver's season-opening win against
    the\nGiants.\n\nBaltimore officials said there were some indications coming from
    the Broncos\nthat Davis may have a new setback in the form of a stress fracture
    injury,\nsimilar to the one he suffered in his lower left leg last year. Davis
    was\nexpected to miss six weeks after having surgery to remove debris and repair\na
    small cartilage tear on Sept. 20.\n\nDavis, who gained 101 yards on 21 carries
    in the Broncos' opener, missed 24\nof 33 games in 1999-2000 due to leg injuries.
    The Broncos have described his\nright knee troubles as a degenerative condition,
    and it was thought that\nShanahan was not counting on Davis as anything other
    than a fallback option\nthis season behind Anderson and Gary. Anderson tore his
    right anterior\ncruciate ligament in 1999, then suffered ankle and stress fracture
    injuries\nin his left leg last year.\n\nThis is the second time in about six months
    that the Ravens and Broncos have\ngotten close to a deal for a running back, only
    to have Denver back away in\nthe end. On the first day of the NFL draft in late
    April, the Broncos were\noffering Anderson to the Ravens in exchange for a second-round
    pick.\nBaltimore officials said they were agreeable, but that Shanahan changed
    his\nmind and pulled the offer off the table. Sources say some within the Ravens\norganization
    feel twice burned at this point in terms of trade talks with\nDenver.\n\nGary,
    26, is the youngest running back in the Broncos' stable of three\n1,000-yard rushers.
    He gained 1,159 yards in just 12 games after replacing\nthe injured Davis in 1999,
    then saw his 2000 season cut to just one game by\nan ACL injury. He is currently
    Anderson's backup.\n\nGary's contract with Denver ends after this season. The
    team has not made\nmuch progress toward an extension. Anderson's deal was extended
    just before\nthe Broncos' season-opening game.\n\nBaltimore has been involved
    in off-again, off-again trade talks with Denver\nabout Gary since Aug. 8, when
    it lost its leading rusher, Jamal Lewis, to a\nseason-ending ACL injury. The Ravens
    signed veteran Terry Allen to replace\nLewis, and Baltimore has been making do
    with a combination of Allen and\nsecond-year veteran Jason Brookins.\n\nBaltimore
    officials say the Broncos instigated the latest round of trade\ncommunication,
    contacting the Ravens to re-start the Gary talks in recent\ndays. Considered the
    AFC's top two Super Bowl contenders, both teams are\nunderachieving at 3-3 and
    coming off consecutive road losses.\n\nDavis has practiced the last two weeks
    on the Broncos scout team, and\noriginally was expected to return in time for
    the Nov. 5 game at Oakland.\nBut on Monday, Shanahan held out the possibility
    that Davis could return a\nweek early, in time for Sunday's game against the New
    England Patriots.\nDavis' showing in practice this week would make the determination,
    Shanahan\nsaid.\n\n\n[ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [  OUR VIEW  ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ]
    ] ] ] ] ] ]\n\n\nAre these guys worth the headache?   I think not.   I'd expect
    some rebuttal\n/ denial from the Denver side this morning to follow.   Don Banks
    is well\nrespected and of course, Sports Illustrated is at the top of our game
    but\nI'm always a little leery of the unnamed \"Raven sources\".   Could be sour\napples
    on a trade that didn't go right for them.   Or it could be exactly\nhow it is.
    \  Bottom line is this certainly doesn't look good for Davis\nowners.   Let's
    see what the Broncos say and you can go from there.\n\nOf course, you can always
    do the smart thing and rid yourselves of any\nDenver RBs.   Not promising you'll
    win your league but you may come out\nahead with the money you save on Rolaids...\n\nMore
    today.\n\nJoe\n\nThanks to Footballguy Chris Smith (Smitty on our message boards)

  subject: ! '[Footballguys] Update # 133 Our Doc On Knee Injuries'
  body: ! "As you may know, we're fortunate to have several Physicians \"on staff\"\n(amazing
    what a T-shirt and cap will do...).   Seriously, these guys are not\njust Fantasy
    Football Junkies, they're Physicians who deal with these types\nof injuries for
    a living.   Every once in a while, we'll get one of our Docs\nto share some insights.
    \  Today is one of those times.\n\nOne of our readers in a dynasty league asked
    me today whether Marcus\nRobinson's ACL / LCL injury was worse than Germane Crowell's
    Patella Tendon\ninjury.   I may not know a lot but I know when I'm over my head
    so this\nquestion was immediately passed on to Footballguy.com Physician, Dr.
    C.J.\nCoshal, MD.\n\nHere's his reply:\n\nHi Joe,\n\nGood question.    Glad to
    help.    First, both of these are season ending\ninjuries.    ACL injuries used
    to be career enders, but no more.\n\nWith more refined surgery and stapling techniques
    the ACL can be repaired.\nIt however is the major stabilizing ligament to the
    knee joint and it takes\na lot of rehab to get back the mobility and feeling comfortable
    so that the\nrepair is going to support you when you cut.    That is why most
    guys with\nACL injuries; come back the next year but don't do as well as the second\nyear
    after the injury.\n\nIf it had just been Marcus' LCL or MCL there was a chance
    he could have made\nit back this season but paired with the ACL, it was a fatal
    blow.\n\nAlthough Crowell's injury ends his season - in theory, it should have
    far\nless implications for long term recovery.    First, to repair this you don't\neven
    need to open the knee joint.    The repair is done by stapling the\ntendon to
    the top of the main bone in the lower leg - the tibia.    Anytime\nyou can avoid
    opening a joint space, recovery is quicker.    Now it will\nstill take a lot of
    rehab - thousands of leg lifts without and then with\nweights but once the muscle
    strength is regained from just nonuse - the leg\nwill be strong and stable.    It
    will be much less affected by cutting, etc.\nThe biggest problem for Germane is
    to be aggressive with strength\nconditioning so it doesn't limit his jumping ability.
    \   He's pretty tall so\neven if he loses a couple of vertical leap inches it
    wont be that\nnoticeable.\n\nSo to make this short and sweet - anytime you have
    a choice between players\nwith these two injuries occurring at the same time you
    can bet\n\nA) The ACL / MCL / LCL injury will take longer to recover from\n\nB)
    That ACL / MCL / LCL injury has more implications for running and cutting\nafter
    the catch.\n\nWhere the art of medicine enters into this is that two different
    individuals\nwill approach their rehab differently.    Someone with a more serious
    injury\nand a more diligent approach to their recovery can still surprise you.
    \   My\nbest guess, Crowell will come back strong by early next season.    Robinson\nwill
    be slower to recover and you have to see how that affects him.    Can\nhe regain
    pre-injury form? - Yes, but probably not for 1 1/2 - 2 years.\nHope that helps.\n\nBy
    the way, I am not surprised at Hearst's recovery as I predicted but you\nstill
    have to admire the sheer patience and determination it must have\ntaken.  Sounds
    like good qualities for a RB.  Unfortunately for Robert\nEdwards, he had the heart
    but there are some injuries you CANT come back\nfrom.\n\nI am also less than surprised
    at Eddie George's slow start.    I think\neveryone underestimated his toe injury
    - it sounds like such a little thing\nright?    Well, put your foot on the floor
    and push off - where does all the\nweight go --to the base of your toes.    I
    think he can still have good\ngames but probably not till the second half of the
    season.\n\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\n\nThanks Doc!

  body: ! "\nTitle: Crude Oil Price Outlook after September 11 \t\nURL(s):\t\n\nhttp://www20.cera.com/eprofile?u=35&m=2743;\n\n\n***********************************************************************\n\nCERA's
    CRUDE OIL PRICE OUTLOOK\n\nIn this uncertain environment, CERA has made assumptions
    about how events will \nunfold in order to form a price outlook, and then has
    assessed the risks. \n\n* CERA's revised oil demand forecast is for a gain of
    just 0.3 million \nbarrels per day (mbd) in 2002. The trend during 2002 is for
    a sharp year-on-\nyear drop in demand in the first quarter of 0.7 mbd,, followed
    by a 1.3 mbd \nincrease in the fourth quarter as economic recovery sets in. \n\n*
    Contrasting against this message of very weak oil demand growth is CERA's \noutlook
    for a 1.0 mbd year-on-year gain in non-OPEC supply in 2002. \n\n* As a result,
    the potential exists for a dramatic oversupply of oil next \nyear unless OPEC
    restrains its production. CERA's view is that OPEC continues \nto restrain production
    in late 2001 and 2002 in an attempt to shore up prices.\n\n**end**\n\nFollow above

  body: ! "Robinson Done for Season\n\nEntire story:   http://espn.go.com/nfl/news/2001/1022/1267465.html\n\nClipped
    from the ESPN.com article:\n\nCHICAGO -- The Chicago Bears are off to a surprising
    4-1 start, but their\nlatest victory may have come at a high price.\n\nESPN Radio
    1000 in Chicago is reporting that Bears wide receiver Marcus\nRobinson suffered
    a torn anterior cruciate ligament and medial collateral\nligament in his left
    knee in Sunday's win over the Cincinnati Bengals and\nwill miss the rest of the
    season.\n\nRobinson had to be carted off the field with six minutes left in the
    first\nhalf after he injured the knee. The Bears did not disclose the severity
    of\nthe injury after the game.\n\nThe reported injury is a major blow for Robinson,
    who was coming off back\nsurgery after missing the final four games of the 2000
    season with a bulging\ndisc.\n\nRobinson ranked second on the team with 23 catches
    for 269 yards and two\ntouchdowns this season.\n\nRookie David Terrell, Chicago's
    first-round pick, and Dez White likely will\nshare the starting receiver's spot
    in Robinson's absence. Marty Booker is\nthe Bears' leading receiver with 30 receptions
    for 331 yards and three\ntouchdowns.\n\nRobinson, 26, emerged as one of the top
    receivers in the NFL in 1999,\nsetting a Bears single-season record with 1,400
    yards receiving and 84\nreceptions along with nine touchdowns. Robinson's yardage
    total was second\noverall in the NFC.\n\nIn 11 games last season, Robinson had

  subject: Jeff McMahon Named CFO
  body: ! "\nToday we announced the appointment of Jeff McMahon as Enron's chief financial
    officer.  In my continued discussions with the financial community yesterday and
    today, it became clear that this move was required to restore investor confidence.
    \ Jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of
    Enron.  He is already on the job and hard at work on the issues before us.  Andy
    Fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company.  \n\nJeff had been serving
    as chairman and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets. He joined Enron in 1994 and spent
    three years in the London office as chief financial officer for Enron's European
    operations.  Upon returning to the U.S., Jeff was executive vice president of
    finance and treasurer for Enron Corp.  In 2000, he was named president and chief
    operating officer of Enron Net Works.\n\nI know all of you are concerned about
    the continuing decline in our share price.  I am too, and we are working very
    hard to turn it around.  Appointing Jeff as CFO is one important step in that
    process.  But most of the solution involves just continuing to do our jobs with
    excellence.  The fundamentals of our business are strong, and I think the market
    will begin to see that as we continue to perform.\n\nPlease join me in giving
    Jeff your full support, and thank you for all of your continued hard work."

  subject: ! '[Footballguys] BREAKING NEWS - Anthony Wright Surgery?'
  body: ! "Hi Folks,\n\nI know some of you have roster submission deadlines within
    the hour and I\nwanted to throw this out.\n\nKTCK 1310 in Dallas has confirmed
    to Footballguys.com that Dallas QB Anthony\nWright may require surgery on his
    knee.   It's apparently not responding to\ntreatment as they'd hoped.   If it
    happens, this would put the starting job\nin the hands of Clint Stoerner or Ryan
    Leaf...\n\nIf that's the case, I'd have to think this can't be good for anybody.\nEmmitt
    Smith has a chance with Wright throwing the ball downfield but with\nanother QB
    (likely to struggle) I'd think you have to downgrade all the\nCowboys.   More
    as we hear it.\n\n\nJoe\n\nThanks to Footballguy Gary Slinkard for pointing me
    to this one.\n\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\n\nIf you
    want to know more about the QB situation than anyone can possibly\nwant to know,
    here's a detailed article from Mickey Spagnola:\n\nEntire story:\nhttp://www.dallascowboys.com/cgi-bin/Cowboys/news_mickeys.jsp\n\nOn
    one hand, the Cowboys have \"The Ryan Package.\" On the other hand, they\nhave
    fluid on Anthony Wright's knee.\n\nCould the two be fixin' to collide this week?\n\nWell,
    let's try to answer that, and a whole lot more, as we catch up with\nthese 1-4
    Cowboys who reconvened here at The Ranch on Monday following this\npast weekend's
    inactivity.\n\nYes, Anthony Wright did practice on Monday after missing last week's
    only\ntwo practices with fluid on his knee. He seemed to throw well. But he didn't\nhave
    to run around much, and after practice this excess fluid on Wright's\nright knee
    that was surgically reconstructed in 1997 seemed to subdue his\nmood.\n\n\"Some
    of the swelling is gone,\" said Wright, seemingly still concerned with\nthe knee
    he irritated in the Monday night victory over Washington.\n\nBut that reduced
    swelling did not seem to placate Wright. He seemed worried.\nAn MRI last Thursday
    suggested there was no structural damage. Wright said\nhe was to receive another
    exam by the doctors on Tuesday, which should\nbecome the tell-tale check for this
    week.\n\nAs for head coach Dave Campo, he reaffirmed his belief in Wright as the\nstarter,
    and along with the Cowboys trainers, seemed confident Wright would\nbe able to
    start Sunday against the Arizona Cardinals at Texas Stadium. If\nthe swelling
    does not subside, in all likelihood the fluid would be drained\nfrom Wright's
    knee before the game.\n\n\"He's the starter, and we'll continue to get Ryan Leaf
    extra work, and see\nwhere we're at, at then end of the week,\" Campo said. \"(Leaf)
    is No. 3 right\nnow, but we'll see.\"\n\nThat would seem to be the crack in the
    door, suggesting the Cowboys would\nrather go with Ryan Leaf as the starter if
    the knee gets in Wright's way\nthis week rather than Clint Stoerner. Say what
    you want, that's the\ndifference between 18 NFL starts and no NFL starts.\n\n\"They
    want to put a package together that I'm confident in,\" said Leaf, who\ntook the
    first team snaps in last week's two practices. \"The Ryan package I\nguess. Right
    now, it's getting bigger and bigger every day. They certainly\nseem to want me
    out there when I'm ready.\"\n\nAnd it certainly seems Leaf is doing all he can
    to get ready as soon as\npossible. He comes here early. He leaves late. He works
    on his off day, and\neven though he did take this past weekend off, the fourth-year
    quarterback\nat least took his playbook with him.\n\n\"I'm just eating it alive,\"
    Leaf said of his extra work. \"I took my playbook\nhome,\" as he talked about
    how he and his wife, Nicole, would go through the\nplaybook together, and that
    he'll live in a hotel until she gets them moved\ninto an apartment here in Dallas.
    There is no time to waste.\n\nSo then, knowing there is a Ryan Package, and knowing
    Wright's knee isn't\nright just yet, would Leaf be ready to start on Sunday against
    the Cards if\nWright wasn't?\n\n\"That's probably asking a lot,\" Leaf said. \"Clint
    knows the offense well,\nand would deserve to start. But I'll be as ready as I
    can.\"\n\nAnd if asked by the coaching staff if he was ready to start, Leaf said,
    \"I\nprobably couldn't do as many things, but I'll never say no.\"\n\nAnd for
    a guy who hasn't experienced much success in the league, at least\nnot what you'd
    have expected from the second pick in the 1998 draft, at\nleast that's a good
    sign. He hasn't lost any confidence in himself....\n\nSpeaking of his first three
    seasons in the league, and a shoulder injury\nrobbed Leaf of his 1999 season in
    San Diego, he's thrown 13 touchdown passes\nand been intercepted 33 times while
    starting 18 of 21 games. The guy taken\nin front of him in that 1998 draft, Peyton
    Manning, threw 52 touchdown\npasses and was intercepted 43 times while starting
    32 of 32 games his first\ntwo seasons. And bringing it closer to home, Troy Aikman
    threw 20 touchdown\npasses and was intercepted 36 times his first two seasons....\n\nKnowing
    what you knew about the Cowboys defense going into the season, would\nyou have
    given that unit a snowball's chance in hell of having a higher NFL\nranking than
    say Tampa Bay, Tennessee and the New York Football Giants going\ninto Monday's
    night game to complete Week 6 of play? Get out of here. But it\nsays right here
    in these NFL rankings the Dallas Cowboys are 13th, giving up\n309.6 yards a game.
    And it says Tampa Bay is 14th, the Giants 15th going\ninto their Monday night
    game with Philadelphia, Denver 16th and Jacksonville\n17th. Tennessee? Good gosh,
    the Titans are 26th. Come on, those are teams\nlittered with Pro Bowl defenders.
    Bet they aren't starting a fourth-round\npick and a sixth-rounder at cornerbacks.
    And remember, that's Randall\nGodfrey starting at middle linebacker for the league's
    26th-ranked defense,\nnot Dat Nguyen. But then the Cowboys did get to play Washington....\n\n\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\n\nBryant

    26th \n\nJohn Acquaviva \nPURE ON TOUR - Definitive Rec - Canada \n&\nJohn Curley
    \nPURE - Chicago \n\n---------------------- \n\nPlanes, trains, and/or automobiles
    One way or another John Acquaviva is always on the go and off to the next club
    or party. Despite having DJ?ed full time since 1980, appearing at over 600 international
    clubs and events, having played for about half a million people, he is still as
    busy as ever and in demand like never before. Certainly one of the most eclectic
    DJ's around at the club and festival level, John is well known for his vast record
    collection of over 40,000 pieces of vinyl. Spanning a rather significant period
    of club music and 12\" culture, sometimes even still \"dropping\" a classic or
    old track along with the new. He is one of the very few DJ's who can enhance a
    room as well as appeal to a number of different crowds on different levels which
    explains his high demand. John began his international career in 1989 with Richie
    Hawtin by founding the world renown Plus 8 Records. John and Richie not only launched
    their own careers but also those of Dan Bell as the trio Cybersonik, Kenny Larkin,
    and Speedy J to mention just a few of the artists. They have also founded Defintive
    records to feature house music and artists launching the likes of Robotman, Barada,
    Omegaman and others. Although noted mostly for his DJ?ing, John was actively involved
    as engineer, producer and artist in the formative years and has compiled and extensive
    and impressive discography. The last few years has seen a number of changes to
    the club and party scene. Evolving as ever, the international scene has settled
    down with DJ's taking on club residencies. John was at the forefront of this trend
    and over the last two years, not only has he played in every inhabited continent
    excluding Africa, but you can also find him monthly at Florida 135 in Barcelona
    Spain and the Twilo club in New York. Cities that regularly appear on john?s itinerary
    every two to three months are: San Francisco USA (Nikita and Spundaes ), Montreal
    Canada (Sona ), Essen Germany (Tanzhaus-ex Rote Liebe ), Dusseldorf Germany (Unique
    ). With this regular performance base, the rest of the time is spent trying to
    fill requests from clubs primarily from Europe and now in North America as well
    as all over the world. John has had a quiet but still excellent history for production
    work. The most notable release of late is a DJ mix CD. \"From Saturday to Sunday
    mix\" is his best mix CD to date and was done with the cooperation of John's Spanish
    club where he is resident: Florida 135. It captures John over two sessions and
    is the best example of his mixing and DJ sound to date \n\n_______________________________________________________________________\nPowered

  subject: SEB FOUNTAINE !!! @ HYPERIA
  body: ! "THURSDAY\nOCT 25th\nSEB FONTAINE\nGLOBAL UNDERGROUND = PROTOTYPE- CD Release
    Tour \n\nSeb Fontaine has rescheduled his appearance at HYPERIA. This October,
    25th, the global domination of this heavily demanded DJ Stops in Houston at Hyperia!\n\nSeb
    has dance music in his blood from the day he was conceived in Ibiza - his mother
    is a semi-professional DJ.\nGrowing up in West London, Seb?s initial musical development
    was stimulated by ska, but soon dropped out of sixth form college to pursue a
    career as a DJ. His first ?proper? gig was at Crazy Larry?s on the Kings Road,
    getting paid ?30 a night to spin tunes for a typical Eighties ?sloanie? crew.\n\nBy
    1989, Seb landed a residency at The Fridge, Brixton, where he played mainly hip
    hop and rare groove, swiftly followed a year later by a residency at The Wag,
    playing ragga, rare groove and acid. Next came a residency at Subterania, alongside
    Norman Jay and Jeremy Healy. In 1993, Seb gained his first house residency at
    Glitterati at The Cross.\n\nMalibu Stacey was the next stop for Seb - a night
    he put together and promoted at the Hanover Grand with friend Craig Richards.
    As Malibu got more established, Seb got increasingly restless, and took to the
    road in a big way, focusing more and more outside of London, becoming one of the
    UK?s hardest working ?motorway jocks?. At the same time, music becomes harder
    and deeper.\n\nIn 1998, Seb was offerred a fortnightly residency at Cream, which
    soon became a weekly gig. In 1999, Seb took Ibiza by storm, with Cream at Amnesia.\n\nSeb
    Fontaine clinched the deal with Radio 1 in February 2000, initially to deputise
    for dance shows exclusively on Radio 1, gaining him the nickname ?super-sub?.
    He also joins Radio 1 in its mammoth summer of live music at the major dance festivals,
    and at the station?s own Radio 1 Dance Parties.\n\n\n\n_______________________________________________________________________\nPowered

  subject: Natural Gas Origination
  body: ! "\nOur natural gas business continues to benefit from effective account
    management and resource allocation focused on identifying and responding to the
    needs of our varied customers.  In order to keep our organization optimally structured
    and to facilitate additional growth, we are making the following changes:\n\nProducer/Wellhead
    Group \nThe current mid-market, origination and wellhead pricing activity currently
    within the Central and Eastern Gas Regions will be consolidated with the Derivatives
    group under Fred Lagrasta.  This will create a single business unit focused upon
    the needs of the producing industry within the Eastern U.S.  The producer focus
    in the Western U.S. and Texas will remain unchanged reporting  to Mark Whitt and
    Brian Redmond respectively.\n\nStrategic Asset  Development\nLaura Luce will move
    from her role in the Central Region to lead an effort focused strictly on identifying
    and entering into long-term strategic arrangements within the Central and Eastern
    Regions.  This initiative will focus on a limited number of selected markets that
    provide strategic opportunities for partnering in asset development, asset management
    and optimization.  This effort will continue to work very closely with the regional
    leads.\n\nCentral Origination and Mid-Market\nFrank Vickers will continue his
    current role in the Eastern Region and will assume the leadership role for Mid-Market
    and Origination activity in the Central Region. \n \n\nThere will be no changes
    to the West and Texas Origination groups headed respectively by Barry Tycholiz
    and Brian Redmond. \n\nPlease join us in congratulating Fred, Laura and Frank
    in their new roles.\n\nLouise & John"

  subject: ! '[Footballguys] BREAKING NEWS - TD Says He''s "On Schedule To Play Sunday"'
  body: ! "The latest for you twisting in the wind Denver RB owners.\n\nQuestions
    on Davis' Health Linger\n\nEntire story:\nhttp://www.rockymountainnews.com/drmn/broncos/article/0,1299,DRMN_17_857787,\n00.html\n\nClipped
    from the Aaron Lopez article:\n\nTerrell Davis has enough trouble staying healthy
    without other people\ncreating new injuries for him.   Five weeks removed from
    arthroscopic knee\nsurgery, the Denver Broncos running back was taken by surprise
    Wednesday\nwhen told of news reports saying he may have a stress fracture in his
    leg\nand could be lost for the season.\n\n``At this point in time, I'm on schedule
    to play this Sunday,'' Davis said.\n\nDavis, who has missed five games this year
    and 29 since 1999, admitted that\nhis right knee remains sore, but he has been
    well enough to play on the\nscout team the past two weeks.\n\nHe was part of Denver's
    offense Wednesday as the Broncos (3-3) prepared for\nthis week's game against
    the New England Patriots (3-3). Davis was listed as\nquestionable on the weekly
    injury report.\n\n``Some days he feels good, other days he feels bad,'' coach
    Mike Shanahan\nsaid. ``Is he going to be back this week? Until he actually says,
    `Hey I'm\nready to go and I'm close to 100 percent,' it's all speculation.''\n\nThe
    speculation was rampant Wednesday when the CNNSI.com and the Baltimore\nSun reported
    that a potential trade between Denver and the Baltimore Ravens\nfell through because
    of uncertainty about Davis' health.\n\nBoth stories, citing unidentified NFL and
    Ravens officials, said the Broncos\nwere reluctant to trade backup running back
    Olandis Gary because they were\nworried Davis may not return this season.\n\nThe
    Internet report said Davis may have personally quashed the deal by\ntelling Shanahan
    he was unsure about his status for the rest of the season.\nDavis denied speaking
    with Shanahan about the trade.\n\n``It's difficult because my knee is sore. Can
    I say my knee will never be\nsore again? I can't comment on things I have no control
    over,'' Davis said.\n``As far as it being a stress fracture, at this point, no
    it's not. Does it\nget sore at times? Yes it does, but I don't know what that
    means.''\n\nFinally thought to be healthy, Davis ran for 101 yards in Denver's\nseason-opener
    but needed surgery 10 days later to remove debris from his\nknee. Tests since
    Sept. 20 have shown Davis' legs to be structurally sound.\n\n``We check everything
    out,'' Shanahan said. ``Every X-ray or MRI we've given\nhim has been negative,
    but we'll keep on looking at it, and hopefully he'll\nbe back some time this season.
    But I can't give you a time frame because I\ndon't know.''\n\nIn the meantime,
    the Broncos will continue to use Gary and Mike Anderson in\nthe backfield. Both
    have maintained that they are merely keeping Davis' spot\nwarm until he returns
    to health.\n\n``He's really frustrated. Everyone would be,'' Gary said. ``He's
    got a thing\nwhere he wants to get back on the field and show his critics and
    the guys\nwho have supported him alike that he's back, and he's 100 percent.''\n\n\n[
    [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [  OUR VIEW  ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ]\n\n\nWe told
    you this morning to be leery of the \"unnamed Raven sources\" and that\nyou could
    expect a rebuttal / denial from Denver.   Here it is pretty much\nlike clockwork.
    \  What to believe?   I believe it's a very dicey situation\nhere and I'd avoid
    it if I could.   If you can't, it's my guess (and it's\nhonestly a guess) that
    this week you'll see mostly Anderson with Gary having\nan increased presence and
    very little Terrell Davis.\n\nSomething tells me we'll be talking about this soon...\n\nJoe\n\nThanks

  subject: ! 'Assessing the post September 11 Landscape: CERA''s New Global Energy
    Initiative'
  body: ! "Assessing the post September 11 Landscape: CERA's New Global Energy\nInitiative\n\nThe
    uncertainties created by the attack on September 11 and the global\nresponse have
    created turmoil for near-term energy planning and\ninvestment decision making.
    Circumstances demand rapid reassessments of\nnear-term risks and strategies. In
    response to client requests, CERA is\nundertaking a comprehensive, new initiative
    to develop a framework for\nunderstanding potential energy futures and their implications.
    \ This\nspecial multiclient project will include interactive analyses,\nface-to-face
    workshops, and real-time updates. It will draw on CERA's\nbroad industry and regional
    expertise, offering participants both a\nframework and a robust tool for evaluating
    strategies across all sectors\nof the energy business and all geographies. The
    focus will be on\ncreating new and highly relevant insights into the energy future
    and the\npolitical and economic context. It will highlight both key trends and\nprobable
    discontinuities -- and assess urgent issues in a setting that\nwill promote thoughtful
    and informed dialogue.\n\nBy emphasizing both virtual and in-person exchanges
    among participating\nmembers and CERA experts, we will establish a three-year
    road map for\ndecision makers across the energy business, to complement CERA's\nindustry-specific
    and shorter-term analyses. In addition, the process\nwill offer a unique opportunity
    to interact with others across the\nenergy spectrum and to share ideas and experiences.\n\n*
    Could the economic slowdown be prolonged and inflation be rekindled?\n* What is
    the impact on energy demand -- does the fuel mix shift?\n* How great are the risks
    for disruptions of supply? In which countries\nand for which fuels?\n* How would
    disruptions play out?  And how tumultuous will they be for\nenergy companies?\n*
    How will energy policies change -- relative to energy security,\nenvironmental
    trade-offs, and fuel strategies?\n* Will the global coalition hold, or are we
    moving to a more divided and\nmore fractured world?\n* How profound will be the
    changes for the energy business?\n\nThis timely series provides a three-year horizon
    that draws on the\nframework established in CERA's longer-term scenarios. It uses
    the clash\nbetween the \"Fragmentation\" and \"Globality\" scenarios as the starting\npoint
    for assessing the new world in which energy-decision makers will\noperate and
    the critical choices they will face.\n\nThe first workshop will be held in Houston
    on November 15, in\nconjunction with CERA's Fall Roundtable series.  Additional
    workshops,\nboth in Houston and other cities and via online technologies, will\nfollow.
    We will announce the entire schedule, with events and\ndeliverables, soon. The
    process will deliver a clear framework for\nanticipating the future, and conclusions
    for energy strategy. \n\nFor more information, please contact Steve Haggett at
    shaggett@cera.com,\nor +617 441 2646."

    when Ricky can play, he'll play again.\" If you have the roster room, it would

    for Sunday's game against New Orleans. \"I'm just taking the same posture that
    we did a week ago,\" Martz said. \"I would not expect Marshall to be up (active)
    for this game. He's got to be 100 percent before I'll be convinced that we've
    got to let him play.\" Trung Canidate would once again start in Faulk's absence

    \         </font></p>\n        <p><font face=\"Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\"
    size=\"2\" color=\"#ff0000\">Time: \n          Early afternoon to evening (complete
    schedule coming soon)<br>\n          What: Who can party harder than Playboy?
    Early morning/afternoon, we'll \n          be drinking bellini's and mimosa's
    while watching Pro golfers battle \n          for the finals. ESPN, Sport's Illustrated,
    and many other media crews' \n          will be filming the action. We're talking
    about having golf cart races \n          with Limp Bizkit, Incubus, and Playboy
    Bunnies on the Golf Course. Drinking \n          the best, frozen margaritas and
    eating continental cuisine by the pool \n          with Playboy Bunnies, Hawaiian
    Tropic chicks, and surprise celebrities \n          and rock star's. We can all
    become Hugh Hefner for a few days while \n          our photographer snaps our
    pictures with over 30 centerfolds. At night, \n          we'll be drinking, laughing,
    and dancing ourselves into a bliss! You \n          won't remember what happened
    the next morning but you'll be happy!<br>\n          </font></p>\n        <p><font
    face=\"Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\" size=\"2\" color=\"#ff0000\">Where:
    \n          Playboy TAKES OVER Caesar's Palace Hotel- we'll own the place! Strict
    \n          security will keep the paparazzi and the riff-raff out.<br>\n          Celebrities:
    Playboy won't release this information until the day of \n          the event
    but rumors are Vin Diesal (Fast and Furious, Pitch Black, \n          Saving Private
    Ryan movies), a few famous faces, and of course?us! \n          E! Entertainment,
    Maxim, and Playboy magazine will be there as well. \n          <br>\n          OUR
    STATUS: If you walk in with Sean Star, the red carpet to fame will \n          always
    be unrolled for you! ALWAYS VIP with Playboy, since I cover (journalistically)
    \n          all their parties worldwide. Everything has been taken care of for
    our \n          all access Press Passes. You will be treated no different than
    Bill \n          Gates or Ricky Martin!</font></p>\n        <p><font face=\"Verdana,
    Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\" size=\"2\" color=\"#ff0000\">CONSIDER \n          THIS:
    I'm bringing one of Houston's best photographers to follow us \n          around
    and shoot pictures of the event and all of us with celebrities, \n          BABES,
    and anything cool. You will ALL get copies of the digital and \n          print
    pictures. You will also likely be published in many magazines \n          and
    websites we contribute the content to. I will also make each of \n          us
    a commemorative photo album/binder for us all to remember this incredible \n          experience.

  subject: ! '[Footballguys] BREAKING NEWS - Correction - Swayne to Start for Chrebet'
  body: ! "Hi Folks,\n\nGetting new information on the Wayne Chrebet situation.   Appears
    that\nRookie WR Kevin Swayne will get the start and not Matthew Hatchette.\n\nHere's
    the story from Bloomberg:\n\nEast Rutherford, New Jersey, Oct. 24 (Bloomberg)
    -- New York Jets receiver\nWayne Chrebet and defensive tackle Shane Burton will
    miss this Sunday's game\nagainst the Carolina Panthers because of injuries sustained
    in last\nweekend's loss to St. Louis.\n\nChrebet has had migraine headaches following
    a hit to his head from\ndefensive tackle Brian Young in a 34-14 defeat this past
    Sunday. Chrebet,\nwho had a concussion the previous week against Miami, didn't
    sustain a\nsecond concussion against the Rams, Jets coach Herman Edwards said.\n\nChrebet
    has started all six games this season and is fourthon the Jets with\n15 catches
    for 226 yards. The seven-year National Football League veteran\nhad 69 catches
    for 937 yards and eight touchdowns last season.\n\nWith Chrebet out, Kevin Swayne
    will start along with Laveranues Coles when\nthe Jets (3-3) visit the Panthers
    (1-5) on Sunday. Swayne, an undrafted\nrookie from Wayne State in Nebraska, has
    one catch for 16 yards this year.\n\n\n[ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [  OUR VIEW  ]
    ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ]\n\n\nI'd expect to see more than usual from Hatchette
    but it's Swayne who's been\nbacking up Chrebet.   Tough to expect the rookie to
    do a lot being thrust\ninto this situation so I wouldn't count on too much.   Sorry
    for the\nconfusion.\n\nThanks to Footballguy Matt Rosenthal for setting me straight.\n\nJoe\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\n\nBryant

  body: ! 'My home is elevated much higher than the street, and even in the heaviest

    rainy seasons I''ve never seen anything close to flooding in my neighborhood,

    so how can I be in a flood zone?

    Although every effort is taken to ensure the information on the Flood

    Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) is as accurate as possible, it may be that your

    structure was inadvertently included in the Special Flood Hazard Area

    (SFHA). If your house is located on property that has a lowest adjacent

    grade (lowest ground touching the structure) elevation at or above the base

    (1-percent-annual-chance) flood elevation (BFE), you may wish to request a

    Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA) in accordance with Part 70 of the National

    Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) regulations. If your house was raised by fill

    at or above the BFE, you could request a Letter of Map Revision Based on

    Fill (LOMR-F) in accordance with Section 65.5 of the NFIP regulations. If

    FEMA issues a LOMA or LOMR-F and removes the SFHA designation from your

    house, the Federal flood insurance purchase requirement will no longer

    apply. You may then be eligible for a refund of the flood insurance premium

    paid on the current policy year. However, lenders retain the prerogative to

    require flood insurance for all properties as part of their regular lending

    practice, so you may want to check with your lender before requesting a LOMA

    or LOMR-F.'

  subject: ! '[Footballguys] Update # 132 10-23 - RB Notes'
  body: ! "Hi Folks,\n\nLots of shifting with RBs lately on several teams and wanted
    to bring you\nthe latest info as you manage your teams.\n\nLet's jump to it.\n\nJoe\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\n\nChicago's
    Dick Jauron - \"We don't want to be a single-back running team\n\nEntire story:\nhttp://chicagosports.com/bears/content/story/0,1984,165380,00.html\n\nClipped
    from the Fred Mitchell article:\n\nHop on the \"A Train.\"\n\nBears players and
    fans are climbing aboard. But the coaching staff still\nseems to be standing in
    line, waiting to have its ticket punched.\n\nAnthony Thomas rushed for a Bears
    rookie-record 188 yards in 22 carries for\nan 8.5-yard average and one touchdown
    Sunday.\n\nBut those remarkable accomplishments during the Bears' 24-0 trouncing
    of the\nBengals merely earned Thomas the designation of \"the hot back\" of the
    week\nin the eyes of Bears coaches.\n\nThomas' 188 yards rank eighth all time
    among all Bears rushers. It was the\nsixth-best rushing effort against a Bengals
    team.\n\n\"We like our tandem,\" said coach Dick Jauron. \"We don't want to be
    a\nsingle-back running team. I believe James Allen is pretty good. Whoever is\nhot
    ... if he's hot, he'll get more carries.\"\n\nAllen, a fourth-year veteran from
    Oklahoma, rushed for 163 yards in a game\nagainst Baltimore in 1998, only to have
    then-Bears coach Dave Wannstedt say,\n\"Let's not put him in the Hall of Fame
    just yet.\"\n\nThomas alternated with Allen for the first several series Sunday
    until\nThomas clearly outperformed the veteran. Allen wound up with 17 yards on\nseven
    carries (2.4 average). His longest run was 5 yards. Thomas had a long\nrun of
    46 yards, as well as a 23-yard touchdown jaunt.\n\n\"The offensive line did a
    great job,\" Thomas said. \"They were opening up\nlanes that probably anybody
    could run through. Every time you go out, you\nwant to get better.\"\n\nThomas
    routinely bulled his way through the Bengals' defense, requiring\nseveral players
    to bring him down.\n\n\"The guy can pound the football,\" said quarterback Jim
    Miller of the\nsecond-round draft pick out of Michigan. \"He has good feet, he's
    big (6 feet\n1 inch, 230 pounds) and he powers it forward. We knew he was going
    to be\ngood. It was just a matter of time. He's a smart kid. He has picked up
    the\noffense very well.\"\n\nMiller connected on 23-of-30 passes for 232 yards
    and two touchdowns. But it\nwas the running game that buoyed the Bears' offense,
    which netted 435 yards.\n\n\"You just kind of go with the guy who's hot,\" said
    Miller, echoing the\nsentiment of the coaching staff. \"Anthony was just so hot
    and running so\nwell and they were having a hard time tackling him. The coaches
    just kind of\nmade a decision to go with the hot back. We're going to need James
    too. We\nwant to get to the point where there's a 1-2 punch.\"\n\nThe Bengals'
    defense looked punchy in the second half. Thomas had 110 yards\nin only nine carries
    at halftime.\n\n\"Come the fourth quarter, those guys couldn't stop him,\" Miller
    said. \"Our\noffensive line was kicking their fannies again. You could just see
    it on the\nfield. That defensive line wanted no part of our offensive line. They
    were\nabusing those guys.\"\n\nJauron praised Thomas' performance but seemed to
    want to evaluate his effort\nwithin the team concept.\n\n\"We called his number
    more during the game,\" Jauron said. \"But in every game\nwe have 'x' number of
    plays earmarked for him. Sometimes you don't get to\nthem all.\"\n\nIt was in
    an exhibition game against the Bengals on Aug. 4 that Thomas hurt\nhis knee, setting
    him back in training camp.\n\nSunday's record showing raises the bar of expectations
    for Thomas, who\nhadn't rushed for more than 58 yards previously in the NFL.\n\n\"I
    know some of the guys who played, like Gale Sayers and Walter Payton,\"\nThomas
    said. \"And it's a compliment that some of those guys didn't do this.\n\n\"It's
    something that's real high and something I can think about the rest of\nmy life.\"\n\n\n[
    [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [  OUR VIEW  ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ]\n\n\nHard to
    tell how this will go.   We've been expecting Thomas to start\nstealing more and
    more carries but honestly didn't see this explosion coming\nthis soon.   It seems
    pretty clear to me that Thomas has something special\nwhile Allen just doesn't.
    \  This could be a \"motivation\" thing for Thomas so\nhe keeps his head amidst
    the Walter Payton / Gale Sayers talk.   And it\ncould be \"handling\" James Allen
    so he stays positive.   But bottom line is I\nthink you'll continue to see good
    things from Thomas, just maybe not quite\nthe full fledged feature back.   Yet.\n\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\n\nDoug
    Chapman to Start Again\n\nEntire story:   http://www.startribune.com/stories/503/776670.html\n\nClipped
    from the Kent Youngblood article:\n\nMichael Bennett's right ankle is sore enough
    that the Vikings probably won't\nhave to worry this week how to split practice
    time at running back.\n\nDoug Chapman had the best game by a Vikings running back
    this season in\nSunday's victory over Green Bay, a game in which the team had
    its best\nrunning game in four seasons.\n\nSo the question of whom is the starter,
    long-term, wasn't something Vikings\ncoach Dennis Green was worried about Monday.\n\n\"He's
    not ready, No. 1 ...,\" Green said of Bennett. \"So when we get to that\npoint,
    we will look at it. But his ankle is not ready yet.\"\n\nBennett was doing better
    in straight-line running, but hasn't tested his\nability to cut or move side to
    side.\n\n\"I just don't think he's going to be ready in one week,\" Green said.
    \"Ankles\njust don't heal, normally, in one week. He had a pretty serious ankle\n[injury].
    He's working hard at rehabilitation, so the sooner the better.\"\n\nPlayers normally
    don't lose their starting roles because of injury. But\nChapman's performance
    Sunday certainly gave Vikings coaches confidence in\nhis ability.\n\n\"We always
    knew he could run,\" running backs coach Carl Hargrave said. \"It\nwas a matter
    of having an opportunity. And he took advantage of the\nopportunity. ... I think
    we're going to play things out the way they are. As\nlong as you're healthy, you're
    going to stay with the healthy guy.\"\n\nChapman, who gained 90 yards on 22 carries,
    credited the offensive line.\n\n\"I'm glad [the line] got some confidence,\" he
    said. \"That's the main thing.\nThey set the tone, protected [quarterback] Daunte
    [Culpepper], opened some\nholes for me.\"\n\nChapman likely has earned a lot of
    playing time even when Bennett gets\nhealthy. But Green wasn't ready to take that
    issue on yet.\n\n\"The good thing is we can do it any way we want to, because
    we don't put the\nsame value on starting as a lot of people do,\" Green said.
    \"We put it in the\ncontribution, who is going to help us win, that's what it
    comes down to. ...\nSo when it comes to that time we'll look at who is going to
    give us the best\nchance to win. That's who we'll play.\"\n\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\n\nMichael
    Bennett has the commanding lead for Rookie Bust of the Year.   Doug\nChapman looked
    excellent and put to rest a lot of the finger pointing by\nBennett supporters
    that the OL or the system was to blame.   Denny Green's\nnot one to admit he was
    wrong too often so I think you'll see that \"serious\nankle\" injury linger for
    as long as Chapman keeps performing.   Don't\nforget, this kid scored about 200
    TDs (okay, 61...) when he was at Marshall.\nHe's a player, so don't count him
    out.\n\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\n\nCanidate to Likely
    Get Another Start\n\nEntire Story:   http://www.stltoday.com/stltoday/sports/\n\nClipped
    from the Nick Wishart article:\n\nGet ready for more Trung Canidate. The Rams'
    No. 2 running back probably\nwill start again Sunday at home against the New Orleans
    Saints with Marshall\nFaulk expected to be a scratch for the second week in a
    row.\n\n\"I wouldn't expect Marshall to be up for this game,\" coach Mike Martz
    said\nMonday, adding that Faulk will be listed as questionable on the midweek\ninjury
    report. \"He's got to be 100 percent before I would be convinced that\nwe've got
    to let him play. And if he's not, then he doesn't play.\"\n\nFaulk sat out practice
    last week and missed Sunday's game because of a\nbruised right knee suffered a
    week earlier against the Giants. Canidate, in\nhis first career start, performed
    brilliantly in relief, rushing for 195\nyards and two touchdowns in the Rams'
    34-14 win over the New York Jets.\n\nMartz described Canidate's performance as
    a \"relief.\" But, he added, \"It\ndoesn't change whether Marshall would be up.
    You just can't do that. You are\nreally running a risk. We've got so much of the
    season left. We've got to do\nthe right thing. We're just going to see where he
    is probably Wednesday or\nThursday.\"\n\n\n[ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [  OUR VIEW
    \ ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ]\n\n\nLooks like you Canidate owners can pony
    up for another week.   Clearly, this\nis a radically different situation than
    with Michael Bennett as Faulk will\ncertainly be the starter once he's ready.
    \  It's just that with Canidate's\ngreat performance, Coach Martz can take his
    time letting Faulk get back to\n100%.   In a league full of teams not fulfilling
    expectations, you can be\nsure the Rams are determined to keep meeting their lofty
    goals and that\nmeans having Faulk at full speed for the longest time possible.
    \  They'll\nface New Orleans this week and then have week 8 off for their bye.
    \  That's\neven more reason not to push him back too early.   We can wring our
    hands in\nweek 9 as to who'll get the carries but for me, I'd expect another week
    of\nCanidate for now.   An early matchup thought to keep in mind though:   The\nJets
    rank # 31 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks while\nNew Orleans
    ranks # 7.\n\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\n\nMixed Signals
    on Shaun Alexander\n\nEntire story:\nhttp://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/sports/134357552_hawk23.html\n\nClopped
    from the Percy Allen article:\n\nKIRKLAND - The key components to their offensive
    resurgence can be traced to\na trio of Seahawks reserves that few had counted
    on just weeks ago.\n\nA pair of backups and a prominent castoff were thrown into
    starting roles\nand because of them, Seattle rebounded from consecutive lopsided
    defeats\nwith back-to-back victories.\n\nConsider running back Shaun Alexander,
    quarterback Trent Dilfer and\noffensive tackle Todd Weiner, improbable stars for
    an improbable team that\nfinds itself among the NFL's elite.\n\nAnd yet when 3-2
    Seattle, one of six AFC teams with a winning record, meets\n3-2 Miami on Sunday
    at Husky Stadium, Dilfer and Weiner aren't likely to be\nin the starting lineup.\n\nIn
    a few weeks, Alexander will join them on the sideline when Ricky Watters\nrecovers
    from a shoulder injury.\n\nAn unwritten rule in the NFL says players don't lose
    their jobs because of\ninjury. However, Coach Mike Holmgren admits that sometimes
    he follows this\npolicy and sometimes he doesn't.\n\n\"A lot of times you get
    stuck when a player feels like you weren't honest\nwith him,\" Holmgren said.
    \"(There's) a lot of things that can happen.\nGenerally speaking, a veteran player
    who can come back and play, normally he\ndoesn't lose his starting position.\n\n\"But
    every once in awhile, for whatever reasons, you might want to go one\nmore week
    with a certain combination. My main concern is that the player\nknows what we're
    doing.\"\n\n\n[ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [  OUR VIEW  ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ]
    ] ]\n\n\nI, for one have trouble with the \"player can't lose his job to injury\"\nconventional
    wisdom.   If Dilfer's healthy, he'd be my guy.   Although I can\nsee Holmgren's
    angle if he's playing for the long term.  (Although I'd be\nworried about Jerry
    Glanville's famous quote about the NFL stands for \"Not\nFor Long\")   The worry
    for Holmgren from a leadership point of view is\nstaying consistent.   How does
    he bench Dilfer when Hasselbeck is ready but\nnot bench Alexander when Watters
    can go?   If Holmgren is focused on the\nfuture, he could make a case that he's
    being consistent in keeping a long\nterm focus.   Few people think Dilfer is the
    long term guy and most everyone\nexpects Alexander to take over for Watters next
    season.   Therefore, he'd be\nplaying his future guys.   You've probably got a
    couple more weeks before\nyou have to worry about this but it might make a difference
    in your trade /\nfree agency dealings.\n\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\nThat'll

  body: ! "HYPERIA\nhttp://www.clubhyperia.com\n\nPURE CHICAGO @ HYPERIA\n\nOCTOBER
    26th\nJohn Acquaviva\nPURE ON TOUR - Definitive Rec - Canada \nJohn Curley\nPURE
    - Chicago\n----------------------\nPlanes, trains, and/or automobiles \n\nOne
    way or another John Acquaviva is always on the go and off to the next club or
    party.\n\nDespite having DJ?ed full time since 1980, appearing at over 600 international
    clubs and events, having played for about half a million people, he is still as
    busy as ever and in demand like never before. \nCertainly one of the most eclectic
    DJ's around at the club and festival level, John is well known for his vast record
    collection of over 40,000 pieces of vinyl. Spanning a rather significant period
    of club music and 12\" culture, sometimes even still \"dropping\" a classic or
    old track along with the new. He is one of the very few DJ's who can enhance a
    room as well as appeal to a number of different crowds on different levels which
    explains his high demand.\n\nJohn began his international career in 1989 with
    Richie Hawtin by founding the world renown Plus 8 Records. John and Richie not
    only launched their own careers but also those of Dan Bell as the trio Cybersonik,
    Kenny Larkin, and Speedy J to mention just a few of the artists. They have also
    founded Defintive records to feature house music and artists launching the likes
    of Robotman, Barada, Omegaman and others.\n\nAlthough noted mostly for his DJ?ing,
    John was actively involved as engineer, producer and artist in the formative years
    and has compiled and extensive and impressive discography.\n\n  The last few years
    has seen a number of changes to the club and party scene.\nEvolving as ever, the
    international scene has settled down with DJ's taking on club residencies. John
    was at the forefront of this trend and over the last two years, not only has he
    played in every inhabited continent excluding Africa, but you can also find him
    monthly at Florida 135 in Barcelona Spain and the Twilo club in New York. \nCities
    that regularly appear on john?s itinerary every two to three months are: San Francisco
    USA (Nikita and Spundaes ), Montreal Canada (Sona ), Essen Germany (Tanzhaus-ex
    Rote Liebe ), Dusseldorf Germany (Unique ).\n  \n\n\nWith this regular performance
    base, the rest of the time is spent trying to fill requests from clubs primarily
    from Europe and now in North America as well as all over the world.\n\nJohn has
    had a quiet but still excellent history for production work.\n\nThe most notable
    release of late is a DJ mix CD.\n\"From Saturday to Sunday mix\" is his best mix
    CD to date and was done with the cooperation of John's Spanish club where he is
    resident: Florida 135. It captures John over two sessions and is the best example
    of his mixing and DJ sound to date\n\n\n\n_______________________________________________________________________\nPowered

  subject: ! '[Footballguys] Not Yet Breaking News - All I''ve Got On Edgerrin James'
  body: ! "Hi Folks,\n\nLike you, I'm scrambling to try and find anything on Edgerrin
    James this\nafternoon.\n\nAs of 4:27 EDT, the latest I have is he says he'll be
    fine isn't especially\nworried.   I do NOT however have news on how the MRI results
    came back.   As\nsoon as I do, I'll shoot to you.   If things go as they usually
    do, I'll get\nthe new information about 2 minutes after I send you this update...
    \ Oh\nwell.\n\nSticking with the \"You'll Know What I Know\" philosophy, here's
    what I have\nfor now:\n\nhttp://starnews.com/print/articles/sideb26.html\n\nClipped
    from the Phillip B. Wilson article:\n\nJames Assures Everyone He'll Be Ready for
    Next Game\n\nKANSAS CITY, Mo. -- Peyton Manning had the same sinking feeling a
    week ago,\nstaring in disbelief as one of the Indianapolis Colts' famed \"Triplets\"
    went\ndown and stayed down with a leg injury.\n\n\"I don't like it at all,\" the
    Colts quarterback said. \"There's no\nreplacement for Edgerrin James.\"\n\nThe
    durable James had his left knee bent awkwardly by Kansas City linebacker\nMarvcus
    Patton with 4:26 remaining and the Colts clinging to a 28-21 lead\nover the inspired
    Chiefs on Thursday night at Arrowhead Stadium.\n\nA grimacing James looked up
    and eventually caught the eye of Pro Bowl\nteammate Marvin Harrison, the Triplet
    who gave his teammates a scare when\nhis leg buckled in the third quarter last
    week.\n\n\"I told him I'd be back,\" James said.\n\nJames didn't make it back
    for the Colts' 35-28 triumph, but that wasn't his\ndecision. He said he wanted
    to go back into the game.\n\nThe NFL's two-time reigning rushing champion is expected
    to have an MRI exam\ntoday, just to be safe, but he isn't worried about being
    ready for the next\ngame, Nov. 4 at Buffalo. He joked with teammates after his
    shower and didn't\neven have ice on his knee.\n\n\"I'm going to be all right,\"
    he said with a smile.\n\n\"Something wasn't right, I felt some pain and knew something
    wasn't right.\nThen the pain started to go away, so I knew it couldn't be too
    bad.\"\n\nJames caught everyone by surprise. The Pro Bowl runner has been as rugged
    as\nhe's been consistent. He has 151 of the Colts' 184 rushing attempts this\nseason
    for 662 yards. As a rookie out of the University of Miami, he had 369\ncarries
    for 1,553 yards rushing. His second year, he upped both totals to\n387 carries
    for 1,709 yards.\n\n\"I was shook up,\" Harrison said. \"I was shook up last week
    when it happened\nto me and Edge was more worried about me. This time, I was shook
    up about\nhim.\n\n\"You don't think that about Edgerrin. Him being down awhile
    was scary.\"\n\nManning, one of the last to enter the Colts' triumphant locker
    room, stopped\nat James' locker and tapped his tailback on the shoulder.\n\n\"How
    is it?\" the quarterback asked.\n\n\"I'll be all right,\" James said, for seemingly
    the hundredth time.\n\nDespite missing the final minutes, James finished with
    102 yards rushing on\n27 carries. That gives him 24 100-yard rushing games in
    his 38-game NFL\ncareer, tying Eric Dickerson for the most in Colts history.\n\nColts
    coach Jim Mora also didn't seem worried that James' injury might be as\nsevere
    as it looked on slow-motion television replays.\n\n\"I don't think it's serious,\"
    Mora said. \"They were in there examining a bit\nago. I think he'll be OK. I can't
    give any prognosis about next week. We do\nhave a little longer time to recover
    and hopefully he'll be ready.\"\n\nOn the first play of the final quarter, James
    broke free on third-and-one\nand ran 20 yards to the Chiefs' 33. It set up Mike
    Vanderjagt's 42-yard\nfield goal to give the Colts a 20-14 lead with 13 minutes
    remaining.\n\nOn the Colts' next offensive series, Manning audibled at the line
    of\nscrimmage and hit Harrison for a 47-yard touchdown pass. James added two\npoints,
    catching a Manning pass in the flat and running to the left corner\nof the end
    zone to give the Colts a 28-14 lead with 8:21 left.\n\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\n\nI'm
    still wanting to hear official word.   Knee injuries are weird.   The\nfirst time
    Jamal Anderson wrecked his knee in college, he stayed in the game\na good while
    after the injury.   Just because James says it doesn't feel too\nbad, doesn't
    have him out of the woods yet.   Stay tuned.   If you can grab\nDominic Rhodes
    with little cost, it might not be a bad idea.   If nothing\nelse, it'll be fun
    for taunting the James owner in your league.\n\nIf you hear anything on James,

    you may have heard, the announcers for the game last night reported that\nAlexander

  subject: ! '[Footballguys] BREAKING NEWS - Warrick Dunn Likely Out - Keyshawn Johnson
    Better'
  body: ! "Warrick Dunn Likely Out - Keyshawn Johnson Better\n\nEntire Story:\nhttp://www.buccaneers.com/newsroom/newspage.asp?newsid=1754&backpage=\n\nClipped
    from the Buccaneers Website:\n\nFriday's practice at One Buccaneer Place started
    without running back\nWarrick Dunn, which means Sunday's game probably will, too.\n\nDunn
    was still in the training room when the Tampa Bay Buccaneers began to\npass and
    run the ball late Friday morning, and though he joined the team\nonfield a few
    minutes later, it was in sweats and running shoes.\n\nAfterward, Head Coach Tony
    Dungy made it clear that he does not expect Dunn\nto play against the Vikings
    this weekend, and the same holds true for WR\nJacquez Green (groin strain).\n\n\"Warrick
    did not practice and Jacquez didn't practice,\" said Dungy. \"I would\nsay there
    be doubtful, but other than that we have a shot to have everyone\nelse.\n\n\"Really,
    Warrick and 'Quez, unless they had a miracle recovery, probably\nwould not play.
    Right now, we're saying doubtful. We haven't ruled them out,\nbut we're as close
    to that as we can be, I guess.\"\n\nFriday is often the best determinant for a
    player's readiness for Sunday,\nand neither Dunn nor Green looked close to ready
    for the final full-scale\npractice of the week. Dungy was concerned both about
    their productiveness on\nSunday and their potential for further injury.\n\n\"Today
    they couldn't go, couldn't run,\" he said. \"Unless they can run full\nspeed by
    Sunday, we shouldn't play them. If they're not running full speed,\nit's tough
    to get anything done and you are more vulnerable (to injury).\"\n\nThis is the
    Buccaneers' final season as part of the NFC Central Division,\nbut Dunn keeps
    seeing dates on his farewell tour cancelled. A foot sprain\nsuffered against Minnesota
    a month ago caused him to miss the Bucs' home\nopener with Green Bay on October
    7. In that contest, FB Mike Alstott carried\n15 times for 77 yards, including
    a late-game 39-yard breakaway that scored\nthe winning points in a 14-10 decision.
    It is likely that Alstott will be\nthe primary ballcarrier again this Sunday against
    the Vikings, though\nrunning backs Aaron Stecker and Rabih Abdullah may also get
    their shots.\n\nWith Dunn entering the season as the designated number one rusher
    for the\nBucs' new offense under coordinator Clyde Christensen, Alstott has found
    his\ncarries somewhat limited. He has averaged just over six carries per contest\nso
    far, picking up 132 yards and one touchdown on 31 carries. He has\naveraged an
    impressive 4.3 yards per carry.\n\nWide receiver Keyshawn Johnson, who started
    the week as questionable but has\nsince been upgraded, also continued his path
    towards playing against the\nVikings.\n\n\"Derrick practiced today and went through,\"
    said Dungy. \"He's doing fine and\nshould be okay by game time, I think. Keyshawn
    practiced and went through.\nWe'll see how they are tomorrow but they look like
    they could be able to\nplay.\"\n\nThat would mean the Bucs would still have the
    NFC's leading receiver in the\nlineup, though his starting mate, Green, will probably
    sit the game out. If\nhe does, fifth-year wideout Reidel Anthony would take his
    place. Anthony has\n34 career starts with the Buccaneers, two more than Green.\n\n\n[
    [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [  OUR VIEW  ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ]\n\n\nThis pretty
    much sums it up.   Alstott moves up of course.   Keyshawn does\nas well.\n\nJoe\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\nBryant

  subject: ! '[Footballguys] BREAKING NEWS - Brookins Looking Like a Starter'
  body: ! "Hi Folks,\n\nHere's the latest on the Raven Running Back situation.\n\nBrookins
    Looking Like the Starter\n\nEntire story:   http://www.sunspot.net/sports/football/bal-sp.ravensnotes\n\nClipped
    from the Paul McMullen and Jamison Hensley article:\n\nAfter he was released by
    the Ravens and Oakland Raiders last year, Jason\nBrookins hooked up with the Jacksonville
    Jaguars' practice squad.\nBrookins could get his first NFL start against those
    same Jaguars on Sunday\nat PSINet Stadium.\n\nThe NFL landscape keeps shifting
    for Brookins, the 25-year-old running back\nwho was just trying to win a permanent
    spot on the Ravens' roster when\ntraining camp began. A season-ending knee injury
    to Jamal Lewis put Brookins\nin the game plan, and a less serious malady affecting
    Terry Allen had coach\nBrian Billick and the 6-foot-2, 225-pound player talking
    yesterday as if he\nwould be Sunday's starter.\n\nAllen is listed as questionable
    on the injury report because of the sprained\nankle that knocked him out of Sunday's
    loss to the Browns. A second-half\nterror in impressive wins over Denver and Tennessee,
    Brookins went down as\nmeekly as the rest of the Ravens in Cleveland, where his
    five carries after\nhalftime netted 6 yards.\n\n\"This is a different role for
    him,\" Billick said. \"He's going to have to\nhold up the whole game. That's something
    you think more about. He'll be a\nlittle hyped up. I'll have to calm him down
    a little bit, but stamina is\nsomething you're more concerned about.\"\n\nAfter
    seeing little first-half action in the first four games, Brookins\naveraged 5.7
    yards a carry in the second halves against the Broncos and\nTitans. After Allen
    went down early in Cleveland, Brookins entered and had\neight rushes for 40 yards
    by halftime, and he scoffed at the suggestion that\nfatigue played a part in his
    late dropoff.\n\n\"It wasn't so much that I was tired, Cleveland's defense just
    buckled down\nin the second half,\" said Brookins, who was taken off the injury
    report\nbecause his shoulder injury responded to treatment. \"We had to start
    passing\nthe ball, and if I could have gotten the ball more, maybe we would have
    had\nmore rushing yards.\"\n\n\n[ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [  OUR VIEW  ] ] ] ] ]
    ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ]\n\n\nWe've been hyping Brookins for a while but he'd never
    been able to move\nTerry Allen out of the way.   Here's his chance.   Clearly,
    back off of\nAllen and if you're ready to roll the dice a bit, take a shot on
    Brookins.\n\nJoe\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\nBryant

    for exactly where I rank players and to determine who to\nstart.   I always receive
    emails asking me how I can have a guy ranked\nhighly on the cheatsheet but listed
    under a matchup that favors the Defense.\nJust because one matchup may be more
    favorable than another, that doesn't\nnecessarily mean I'd start the player with
    the best matchup.   Ahman Green\nmay have a horrible matchup one week but unless
    you're sitting on Edgerrin\nJames or Marshall Faulk, Green's your guy no matter
    who he's lining up\nagainst.   The matchup info is meant to be just one more tool
    in your box\nwhen it comes to deciding between players.\n\nStats are provided
    by Mike Hall's excellent FLM League Management Software.\nhttp://www.fflm.com/
    for more info.   Fantasy Points Allowed by position\nnumbers are from ESPN.com.\nLet's
    get to it.\n\nJoe\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\nRushing
    Game Matchups\n\n\nLocks:  These games feature Defenses that should be overmatched
    against the\nOffense.\n\n\nCarolina's Richard Huntley / Nick Goings / Fred Hoover
    vs New York Jets\nDefense\n\nWho didn't see an injury coming for Biakabutuka?
    \  Or Terry Glenn?   Or Fred\nTaylor?   I know there are lots of arguments out
    there that the \"injury\nprone\" tag is unjustified for some players but in my
    opinion, you shouldn't\nbe surprised to see guys like Biakabutuka go down.   Coach
    George Seifert\nhas said he's giving Huntley the \"Golden Opportunity\" as the
    starting RB\nthis week.   Let's see what he can do with it.   Can't think of a
    better\ndefense to run on than the pathetic Jets.   New York ranks # 31 in Rushing\nYards
    Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks giving up a whopping 186\nrushing yards
    a game.   They rank # 30 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.\nDon't underestimate
    the loss of OL Kevin Donnalley though.   He was a\nvaluable part of the line.
    \  One other semi troubling fact is that Brad\nHoover had 2 Red Zone rushes last
    week.   Still though, if there was ever a\nweek to start Huntley, this is it.\n\n\nDallas'
    Emmitt Smith vs Arizona Defense\n\nIt's hard to get too excited about Emmitt Smith
    these days but this is a\ngood matchup for him.   The Cowboys have had a week
    off and they'll be\nfacing the soft Arizona defense ranked # 26 in Rushing Yards
    Allowed per\nGame over the last 4 weeks.   They're # 28 in Fantasy Points Allowed
    to RBs.\nQB Anthony Wright has another week of practice under the belt and should
    be\nable to provide some passing threat to open the running game.   At least\nthat's
    the theory.   You've got to pick your spots with Smith and this looks\nlike a
    pretty good one if you've been considering playing him.\n\n\nIndianapolis' Edgerrin
    James vs Kansas City Defense\n\nStart James.   Yes, he's in a slump ranking just
    # 12 in Fantasy Points over\nthe last 3 games but you have to start him.  Especially
    against the Kansas\nCity defense that ranks # 29 in Rushing Yards Allowed per
    Game over the last\n4 weeks.   If you doubt a guy like James, remember he had
    7 Red Zone rushes\nlast week.   That's more than a lot of backs have for the season.
    \  He's\ngetting the opportunities.\n\n\nKansas City's Priest Holmes / Tony Richardson
    vs Indianapolis Defense\n\nPriest Holmes had another solid game last week against
    the soft Arizona\ndefense rushing for 85 yards on 15 carries (5.7 ypc)   This
    week, he'll face\nan equally bad Colt defense that ranks # 23 in Rushing Yards
    Allowed per\nGame over the last four weeks.   They rank # 29 in Fantasy Points
    Allowed to\nRBs.   DE Chad Bratzke is doubtful and that'll help Holmes.   For
    now, it\nlooks like Tony Richardson is being eased back into the mix.   Look to
    see\nwhat kind of role he'll take on there but for this week, I think it'll be\nprimarily
    Holmes again.\n\n\nNew York's Tiki Barber / Ron Dayne vs Washington Defense\n\nThe
    Giants Duo was less than impressive running the ball Monday night\nagainst Philadelphia.
    \ But the Redskins rush defense is a different story.\nWashington ranks # 30 in
    Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four\nweeks.   They rank # 31 in
    Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.   I'd expect a\nsimilar distribution in carries
    as we saw Monday night (Barber - 13 ,\nDayne - 16) and I'd expect both of them
    to have solid games against this\nhorrible defense.   Dayne is clearly the Red
    Zone rusher though.   He had 4\nattempts Monday vs just 1 Rushing attempt for
    Barber.  (Barber did have 2\npasses thrown to him in the Red Zone)\n\n\nNew York
    Jet's Curtis Martin vs Carolina Defense\n\nCurtis Martin ran well when he ran
    last week.   It's just that he didn't get\nto run enough.   Martin totaled 63
    yards on 14 carries (4.5) but he needs\nmore than 14 carries.   He'll get them
    this week against a Carolina defense\nthat ranks # 22 in Rushing Yards Allowed
    per Game over the last four weeks.\nCarolina was already thin at LB but with Hannibal
    Navies breaking his arm\nlast week, it's even worse now.   This could be a big
    day for Martin.\n\n\nSan Diego's LaDainian Tomlinson vs Buffalo Defense\n\nTomlinson
    is very good.   The Bills are not.   Buffalo ranks # 27 in Rushing\nYards Allowed
    per Game over the last four weeks.   They rank # 27 in Fantasy\nPoints Allowed
    to RBs.   If you can afford to bench Tomlinson, you probably\ndon't need any more
    help from here.\n\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\n\nPrime
    Matchups:  These games feature Defenses that should have trouble\nstopping the
    Offense.\n\n\nBaltimore's Terry Allen / Jason Brookins vs Jacksonville Defense\n\nKeep
    an eye on the injury reports here as Terry Allen suffered a sprained\nankle last
    week and is iffy for Sunday's game.   Jason Brookins filled in\npretty nicely
    for Allen rushing 13 times for 46 yards (3.5 ypc).   He did\nhave a fumble though.
    \  Jacksonville's struggling and they're not getting a\nlot of help from their
    defense.   They rank # 20 in Rushing Yards Allowed\nper Game over the last 4 weeks.
    \  They're only slightly better in Fantasy\nPoints Allowed to RBs ranking # 16.
    \  There were lots of rumors floating\naround about the Ravens trying to trade
    for a RB.   They apparently don't\nfeel Allen / Brookins are enough to get the
    job done.   Keep an eye on this\nthrough the week to see if Allen can go.   If
    you have to submit your\nlineups by Thursday, I'd be leery of either back though.\n\n\nCincinnati's
    Corey Dillon vs Detroit Defense\n\nThe knock on Corey Dillon has always been his
    inconsistency.   He did little\nto quiet the critics Sunday with a 16 carry for
    30 yard (1.9 ypc) day\nagainst the Bears.   Although you have to give the Bears
    defense credit -\nthey're tough.  This week, he faces a much softer Lions unit
    that ranks # 16\nin Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks.   They're
    # 21 in\nFantasy Points Allowed to RBs.   I'm willing to discount last week's\nperformance
    as a testament to the Bears.   Dillon simply didn't matchup well\nwith the tough
    inside defenders of Chicago and I expect him to fare much\nbetter here.\n\n\nDenver's
    Mike Shanahan vs New England Defense\n\nTake your pick here.  The latest Terrell
    Davis news from Sports Illustrated\nis that he may be injured more than anyone's
    letting on.   And now ESPN's\nJohn Clayton is reporting that Olandis Gary may
    get the start over Mike\nAnderson in an effort to shake up the offense.   Sheesh.
    \ The Broncos are\nstruggling offensively to get much going.   They'll face a
    Patriot team on a\nmajor roll.   Although statistically, they're still giving
    up a ton of\nyards.   The Indy / New England box score from last week was a strange
    one -\nIndy loses 38-17 but has 484 total yards including 179 rushing.   The\nPatriots
    rank # 25 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks\nand also rank
    # 25 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.   When Anderson ran\nlast week, he did
    pretty well gaining 50 yards on 11 carries (4.5 ypc)\nalthough he did have a fumble.
    \  11 carries won't get it done for you\nthough.   If I had to turn in a roster
    Thursday, I'd probably shy away from\nthe whole situation if I could even though
    I'd expect the Broncos as a team\nto run well on New England.\n\n\nDetroit's James
    Stewart / Lamont Warren vs Cincinnati Defense\n\nKeep an eye on this one as James
    Stewart suffered an ankle injury and his\nstatus is uncertain for this week's
    game.   Lamont Warren will go if Stewart\ncan't.   Neither player did a lot against
    Tennessee last week.   Warren had\n18 yards on 6 carries (3.0 ypc)   Stewart had
    17 yards on 9 carries (1.9\nypc)   The Bengal defense is enticing though as they
    rank just # 28 in\nRushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks.   They
    rank # 22 in\nFantasy Points Allowed to RBs.   It's likely a decision on who'll
    play may\nnot come till later this week so understand this is a risky call here
    if you\nmust decide now.\n\n\nPittsburgh's Jerome Bettis vs Tennessee Defense\n\nHow
    can you not start Jerome Bettis?   He ranks # 6 over the last 3 weeks in\nFantasy
    Points among RBs.   The Titans are improving their rush defense and\nnow rank
    # 10 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks.\nFor the year
    though, they rank # 26 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.\nBettis is on a roll
    and I wouldn't want to be in his way come Monday Night\nat their new stadium.\n\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\n\nEven
    Matchups:  These games feature no real advantage either way\n\n\nArizona's Michael
    Pittman vs Dallas Defense\n\nMichael Pittman continues to run well and that shouldn't
    change against\nDallas.   Don't forget about his receiving as he's rolled up 311
    total yards\nover the last 3 weeks.   Dallas is pretty average on defense ranking
    # 15 in\nRushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks.   They rank # 14
    in\nFantasy Points Allowed to RBs.  Thomas Jones did get 7 carries (and a TD)\nlast
    week but I think it'll be primarily Pittman here.\n\n\nMinnesota's Doug Chapman
    vs Tampa Bay Defense\n\nAgainst a very good Packer Defense last week, Chapman
    rushed for 90 yards on\n22 carries (4.1 ypc).   This week, he faces Tampa Bay
    which has fallen all\nthe way to # 21 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the
    last four weeks.\nThey're tougher in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs where they
    rank # 12 for\nthe year.   Pittsburgh rolled up 220 rushing yards against Tampa
    Sunday so\nthey can definitely be run on.   One note of concern is that Jimmy\nKleinsasser
    had 3 Red Zone rushing attempts last week compared to just 1 for\nChapman.   Chapman
    showed a great nose for the endzone in college so let's\nhope that Red Zone distribution
    starts to change.   Tampa has the tough\nreputation but I wouldn't be afraid of
    this matchup at all.\n\n\nNew Orleans' Ricky Williams vs St. Louis Defense\n\nOver
    the last 3 weeks, Ricky Williams is the # 4 RB in Fantasy Points.   He\nstarts
    this week for me regardless of the matchup.   St. Louis ranks # 11 in\nRushing
    Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks.   They rank # 17 in\nFantasy
    Points Allowed to RBs.   Certainly, the high powered Ram offense can\ntake a RB
    out of the game but the numbers show that teams have had some\nsuccess running
    on them.   I'll take my chances with Ricky.\n\n\nOakland's Charlie Garner vs Philadelphia
    Defense\n\nTyrone Wheatley could play this week but I'm doubting it.   I think
    it'll be\nCharlie Garner trying to carry the load.   The Eagles have the tough\nreputation
    but they rank just # 19 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over\nthe last four
    weeks and # 18 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.   Part of\nthat is due to their
    very tough pass defense.   Oakland's coming off a bye\nweek while Philadelphia's
    coming off a short week following a Monday night\ngame.   Don't forget the team's
    ties here.   Jon Gruden and Charlie Garner\nare both former Eagles.   Bottom line
    - I like Gruden's ability to be able\nto create some situations for Garner to
    shine.\n\n\nSeattle's Shaun Alexander vs Miami Defense\n\nThe Miami defense has
    lost some luster ranking # 14 in Rushing Yards Allowed\nper Game over the last
    four weeks.   They're still tough though and having a\nhealthy Zach Thomas will
    be a big plus.   Thomas is mobile and a hard\nhitter.   Alexander is the top ranked
    RB in the league over the last 3 weeks\nwith 4 TDs in his 2 games.   Not sure
    he can keep that pace but you almost\nhave to start him this week.\n\n\nSt. Louis'
    Trung Canidate / Marshall Faulk vs New Orleans Defense\n\nAt this point, it looks
    like Faulk may sit another week and Canidate gets\nthe start again.   Coach Mike
    Martz is claiming he wants Faulk to be \"100%\"\nbefore returning.   Canidate's
    stellar play allows him that luxury.\nAlthough Canidate won't be surprising anyone
    after the huge game last week.\nAnd he doesn't get to play the Swiss Cheese Jets
    again.   New Orleans is\ntough defense ranked # 7 in Rushing Yards Allowed per
    Game over the last\nfour weeks but I'd still roll the dice on Canidate if you're
    needing a home\nrun.   He's got that breakaway potential to score from anywhere.
    \  He also\nhad 6 Red Zone rushing attempts which should put to rest any talk
    that he's\nnot big enough to handle the goalline carries.\n\n\nTampa Bay's Warrick
    Dunn / Mike Alstott vs Minnesota Defense\n\nWarrick Dunn says the injured foot
    / toe will bother him for a while but now\nhe's got a hamstring injury to worry
    about.   He hopes to be able to go this\nweekend although he was ineffective last
    week against Pittsburgh rushing for\n31 yards on 13 carries (2.4 ypc)   That won't
    cut it.   The Minnesota\ndefense is nothing special ranking # 17 in Rushing Yards
    Allowed per Game\nover the last four weeks.   They come in at # 13 in Fantasy
    Points Allowed\nto RBs.   Both the Tampa Bay WRs, Keyshawn Johnson and Jacquez
    Green are\nless than 100% for this game (and may even be unavailable - stay tuned)
    so\nthe Bucs may be forced to run the ball.   The Bucs haven't been scaring many\npeople
    through the air as it was and this will let the defense stack against\nthe run
    even more.\n\n\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\n\nDownside
    Matchups:  These games feature a Defense that could pose trouble\nfor the Offense.\n\n\nChicago's
    Anthony Thomas / James Allen vs San Francisco Defense\n\nCoach Dick Jauron said
    Tuesday he \"doesn't want to be a one back team\" and\nthat even after Thomas'
    incredible performance Sunday, Chicago will still\nuse a RB tandem.   He said
    they'll be \"going with the hot hand\".   It's my\nguess you'll see Thomas have
    the hotter hand again this week.   Last week,\nhe rolled for 188 yards on 22 carries
    (8.5 ypc) and a TD.   He should have\nhad another TD as well getting tackled at
    the 1 after a 46 yard run.   San\nFrancisco is tough against the run ranking #
    6 in Rushing Yards Allowed per\nGame over the last 4 weeks.   Although they're
    just # 19 in Fantasy Points\nAllowed to RBs.   I like Thomas here but be leery
    that Dick Jauron is saying\nJames Allen will still see time.   It's important
    to note that last week was\nthe first week that James Allen did not get a Red
    Zone opportunity.   And it\nwas the first week that Anthony Thomas did get one.
    \  The writing is on the\nwall and it's my opinion that Jauron is trying to smooth
    feathers and keep\nAllen positive.\n\n\nMiami's Lamar Smith vs Seattle Defense\n\nThis
    could be a tough game for Lamar Smith.   He's a between the tackles\nrunner and
    the Seahawks may give him trouble.  DTs Chad Eaton and John\nRandle are a solid
    pair and MLB Levon Kirkland is tough.   Seattle ranks # 6\nin Rushing Yards Allowed
    per Game over the last four weeks.   They also rank\n# 6 in Fantasy Points Allowed
    to RBs.   Travis Minor could see more action\nas the Dolphins like his receiving
    abilities.   Smith is still a solid\nplayer but I'm not excited about this matchup.\n\n\nNew
    England's Antowain Smith vs Denver Defense\n\nAntowain Smith rushed for 71 yards
    on 21 carries (3.4 ypc) against a weak\nColt defense Sunday.   Denver is much
    tougher ranking # 13 in Rushing Yards\nAllowed per Game over the last four weeks.
    \  They're # 11 in Fantasy Points\nAllowed to RBs.   The Patriots are all about
    QB Tom Brady right now and I'd\nexpect him to stay the focus.   Smith will run
    just enough to keep the\ndefense semi-honest.   A decent matchup but certainly
    no cakewalk.\n\n\nPhiladelphia's Correll Buckhalter /  Duce Staley vs Oakland
    Defense\n\nTough to say for certain which back gets the bulk of the work but I
    think\nyou'll still see Buckhalter carry most of the load.   At least until Staley\nshows
    he's back and 100%.   Staley had just 3 carries Monday night but\nshould start
    slowly working his way back into game shape.   It won't be easy\nagainst a tough
    Raider Defense ranked # 9 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game\nover the last four
    weeks.\n\n\nTennessee's Eddie George vs Pittsburgh Defense\n\nGeorge had been
    struggling.   Over the last 3 weeks, he's the 26th ranked\nRB.   Not what you'd
    expect out of him.   The task doesn't get any easier\nthis week against a very
    tough and aggressive Pittsburgh Defense that ranks\n# 8 in Rushing Yards Allowed
    per Game over the last four weeks.   They rank\n# 9 in Fantasy Points Allowed
    to RBs.   George is a power rushing RB who\ndoesn't match up very well with the
    Pittsburgh defense that's built to stop\nthe power game.\n\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\n\nDefensive
    Slam Dunks:  These games feature a very tough Defense posing major\nproblems for
    the Offense.\n\n\nBuffalo's Travis Henry vs San Diego Defense\n\nHenry is running
    hard but he's struggling to produce numbers worthy of your\nstarting lineup.   The
    Offensive Line just isn't creating much for him to\nwork with.   And he's not
    an ultra quick guy who can make something out of\nnothing.   Henry's best bulldozing
    through a hole that's opened and\npunishing tacklers but he's had little chance
    to do that.   I don't see this\nchanging much against a tough San Diego defense
    ranked # 4 in Rushing Yards\nAllowed per Game over the last 4 weeks.   They rank
    # 3 in Fantasy Points\nAllowed to RBs.   All Pro Linebacker Junior Seau is iffy
    for this game and\nthat will certainly help Henry if Seau can't go.   Although
    I still don't\nlike this matchup.\n\n\nJacksonville's Stacey Mack vs Baltimore
    Defense\n\nFred Taylor misses another game.   Like that's news.   Stacy Mack is
    no Fred\nTaylor and unfortunately, they'll be facing a Baltimore defense that's
    as\ntough as ever, despite their record.   The Ravens rank # 1 in Rushing Yards\nAllowed
    per Game over the last 4 weeks.   They also rank # 1 in Fantasy\nPoints Allowed
    to RBs.   Avoid Mack unless you're in a real pinch.  On the\nsubject of Taylor,
    I'm getting a lot of email and I honestly am not hearing\nany more than you apparently
    are (or aren't)   Jacksonville is keeping it\nclose to the vest.   They're saying
    it's possible he'll play next week but\nthat's just a guess at this point.   The
    injury appears to be very serious\nand it's not looking too good.   Not a lot
    you can do at this point though\nif you're a Taylor owner as his trade value's
    already hit rock bottom.\nHang on and hope for the best.\n\n\nSan Francisco's
    Garrison Hearst / Kevan Barlow vs Chicago Defense\n\nChicago continues to rise
    up the defensive charts with a stifling run\ndefense.   Last week, they held Corey
    Dillon down.   Over the last 4 weeks,\nthey rank # 3 in Rushing Yards Allowed
    per Game.   DTs Keith Traylor and Ted\nWashington do a great job of clogging up
    the middle while MLB Brian Urlacher\nis a proven run stopper.   The advantage
    for Hearst and Barlow over Dillon\nis that they run outside more often but still,
    a very touch matchup.\n\n\nWashington's Stephen Davis New York Giants Defense\n\nDavis
    can't seem to find the endzone but he continues to run hard and pile\nup some
    yards.   Over the last 3 weeks, he's gathered 257 total yards which\nis solid.
    \  This looks like a tough week for him though as the Giants rank #\n2 in Rushing
    Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks.   They rank #\n4 in Fantasy Points
    Allowed to RBs.   Davis is the kind of guy who'll likely\ngo off when you least
    expect it but this doesn't look like a good matchup to\nme.\n\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\n\nThat'll

  body: ! "Hi Folks,\n\nHere's how I see the Passing Game Matchups this week.\n\nPLEASE
    NOTE:   See the cheatsheet online www.footballguys.com for exactly\nwhere I rank
    players and to determine who to start.   I always receive\nemails asking me how
    I can have a guy ranked highly on the cheatsheet but\nlisted under a matchup that
    favors the Defense.   Just because one matchup\nmay be more favorable than another,
    that doesn't necessarily mean I'd start\nthe player with the best matchup.   Peyton
    Manning may have a horrible\nmatchup one week but unless you're sitting on Kurt
    Warner or Daunte\nCulpepper, Manning's your guy no matter who he's lining up against.
    \  The\nmatchup info is meant to be just one more tool in your box when it comes
    to\ndeciding between players.\n\nNote:  I've used the player stats sorted by performance
    over the last four\nweeks extensively in developing these write-ups. Stats are
    provided by Mike\nHall's excellent FLM League Management Software.  http://www.fflm.com/
    for\nmore info.\nLet's get to it.\n\nJoe\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\nPassing
    Game Matchups to Avoid and Exploit\n\n\nLocks:  These games feature Defenses that
    should be overmatched against the\nOffense.\n\n\nChicago's Passing Game vs San
    Francisco Defense\n\nQB Jim Miller isn't flashy, but he gets it done.   Losing
    WR Marcus Robinson\nwas a huge blow though and they'll be hard pressed to pick
    up the slack.\nRookie David Terrell will see increased time as will Dez White.
    \  Marty\nBooker is the other WR and he should be solid.   Of the bunch, Terrell
    has\nthe most talent but is by far the least experienced.   Look for him to grow\nup
    in a hurry.   San Francisco can definitely be thrown on as shown by their\n# 26
    ranking in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.\nThey rank
    # 22 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs.   The Bears will likely try\nto flex their
    new found rushing game muscle but I think it'll come down to\nhow well they can
    cover the loss of Marcus Robinson.   It's a good matchup,\nI'm just not sure if
    the Bears can take advantage of it.\n\n\nDenver Passing Game vs New England Defense\n\nBrian
    Griese tries to rally his team against the suddenly dangerous\nPatriots.   New
    England ranks # 22 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over\nthe last four weeks.
    \  That may be just what the Broncos need.   Eddie\nKennison is playing better
    and Rod Smith is facing double and triple teams,\nyet still producing.   Ty Law
    is a solid Cornerback but Otis Smith on the\nother side is vulnerable.   Griese's
    shoulder is sore but he'll play through\nit.   It looks like it may be an issue
    all season.\n\n\nMinnesota Passing Game vs Tampa Bay Defense\n\nDaunte Culpepper
    didn't put up the eye popping stats last week but the\nVikings won a tough game
    against the Packers.   You could see a similar\nperformance this week in this
    important game against Tampa Bay.   The Bucs\nrank # 24 in Passing Yards Allowed
    Per Game over the last four weeks so\nthey've obviously been thrown on.   Randy
    Moss and Cris Carter are solid\nplays as is Culpepper.   I also like TE Byron
    Chamberlain to make some noise\nhere.\n\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\n\nPrime
    Matchups:  These games feature Defenses that should have trouble\nstopping the
    Offense.\n\n\nBaltimore Passing Game vs Jacksonville Defense\n\nHere's all you
    need to know about the Jaguar Pass Defense:  Rob Johnson\nlooked pretty good against
    them last week and was only sacked 2 times.\nThat says a lot.  The Jags rank #
    18 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over\nthe last four weeks but they seem to
    be regressing.   Elvis Grbac is listed\nas Questionable with a rib / chest injury
    and is no lock to start.   Randall\nCunningham would go if Grbac can't.   After
    getting everyone's expectations\nup, WR Travis Taylor disappeared last week having
    only 1 pass thrown his\nway.   Brandon Stokely had 9 and Qadry Ismail had 10.
    \  So it's tough to say\nhow it'll play this week.   I really like Taylor, but
    he sure came up small\nlast week.   Shannon Sharpe is a good play like always
    and rookie TE Todd\nHeap should hopefully see action this week.\n\n\nCarolina
    Passing Game vs New York Jets Defense\n\nQB Chris Weinke seems to be regressing
    a bit after a very solid start.   His\ninterceptions last week were killers.   He
    faces a Jets team that ranks # 21\nin Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the
    last four weeks so he could get\nback on track.  They rank # 20 in Fantasy Points
    Allowed to QBs.   Muhsin\nMuhammad and Donald Hayes will face solid corners Aaron
    Glenn and Marcus\nColeman.   The real damage for Carolina can be done with TE
    Wesley Walls\nwho's always a factor.\n\n\nCincinnati Passing Game vs Detroit Defense\n\nNew
    Flash - Jon Kitna must be more consistent.   For better or worse, the\nBengals
    record seems to mirror his play.   Losing WR Chad Johnson hurt as\nJohnson brought
    a true deep threat to the table - something the other WRs do\nnot.   Darnay Scott
    and Peter Warrick are limited by Kitna's play and don't\nseem to be as active
    as they were earlier.   The Lions rank # 27 in Passing\nYards Allowed Per Game
    over the last four weeks so they can definitely be\nthrown on.   For the year,
    Detroit ranks # 30 in Fantasy Points Allowed to\nQBs so maybe there is hope for
    Kitna this week.\n\n\nKansas City Passing Game vs Indianapolis Defense\n\nQB Trent
    Green should get a break Thursday night against a Colt defense that\nhasn't put
    much pressure on the QB (4 sacks in the last 3 games).   They\nrank # 16 in Passing
    Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   DE\nChad Bratzke is Questionable
    so that should help even more.   WR Derrick\nAlexander is getting back in the
    groove of things with a 4 reception day for\n99 yards and a TD last week.   Chris
    Thomas will likely start but Snoop\nMinnis will see time too.   New England abused
    Cornerback David Macklin last\nweek and the Chiefs should have similar results.
    \  The Colts rank # 28 in\nFantasy Points Allowed to WRs.   As always, TE Tony
    Gonzalez will be a huge\npart of the game\n\n\nNew York Giants Passing Game vs
    Washington Defense\n\nThe big buzz this week is that Coach Jim Fassell is rumored
    to be\nconsidering not starting WR Amani Toomer.   Remember, last year, Toomer
    was\nbriefly demoted and he responded with a great finish.   Even if this\nhappens,
    I don't expect it to be a big deal as Toomer is clearly the Giants\nbest option
    at WR.   QB Kerry Collins struggled with just 162 yards last\nweek against the
    Eagles but Philadelphia is on a different level.   The\nRedskins are ranked just
    # 23 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the\nlast four weeks and the Giants
    should get back on track.\n\n\nNew York Jets Passing Game vs Carolina Defense\n\nThe
    Jet passing game will be without WR Wayne Chrebet this week as he\nrecovers from
    a concussion.   Kevin Swayne will likely get the start in his\nplace and I think
    you'll see a lot more of Matthew Hatchette too.\nTesteverde's been ok but not
    great.   This offense is all about Curtis\nMartin though and I don't see that
    changing.   Although the passing matchup\nis enticing as the Panthers rank just
    # 30 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game\nover the last four weeks.   The Carolina
    Linebacking Corps is in shambles so\nTE Anthony Becht might be a good play.   The
    Panthers rank # 28 in Fantasy\nPoints Allowed to TEs.\n\nSt. Louis Passing Game
    vs New Orleans Defense\n\nStart your Rams.   Yes, New Orleans is solid but each
    one of these St. Louis\nplayers is capable of winning your game for you this week.
    \  Kurt Warner,\nTorry Holt, and Issac Bruce are must starts with Az-Zahir Hakim
    a likely\nstarter for many teams.\n\n\nTampa Bay Passing Game vs Minnesota Defense\n\nInjuries
    are taking their toll on the Buccaneer WRs.   Both Keyshawn Johnson\n(hip flexor)
    and Jacquez Green (groin) are Questionable for this week.  That\ndoesn't bode
    well for them or for QB Brad Johnson.   Minnesota ranks # 25 in\nPassing Yards
    Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks so the opportunity\nis there if they
    can get healthy.   But right now, it's a tough call until\nyou know more.   I'd
    expect both to play but you don't know for sure.   If\nthe WRs are limited, that'll
    obviously drag Brad Johnson's numbers down.\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\n\nEven
    Matchups:  These games feature no real advantage either way\n\n\nDetroit Passing
    Game vs Cincinnati Defense\n\nI've never been a Charlie Batch fan but he's making
    a believer out of me.\nHe blew up against the Titans Sunday with a 338 / 3 TD
    / 1 Interception day.\nThe Bengal Defense has put up good numbers ranking # 6
    in Passing Yards\nAllowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   On the flip side
    to that,\nRodney Heath and Robert Bean are out, so the secondary could be ripe
    for\nBatch this week.   Lions WRs Germane Crowell and Herman Moore are gone but\nJohnnie
    Morton is ready to go.   Larry Foster will be the # 2 WR and don't\ncount him
    out.   Morton can't catch every pass.   Morton has been averaging\n8 targets per
    game but that'll surely rise.   Detroit just signed WR Bert\nEmanuel so all their
    troubles are now over...\n\n\nNew England Passing Game vs Denver Defense\n\nCount
    me on the Tom Brady Bandwagon.   He's done well against several\ndifferent defenses
    both at home and on the road.   He plays a very similar\ngame to fellow Michigan
    grad Brian Griese - He doesn't dazzle you with\nphysicals but he plays a solid,
    heady game.   Don't know for sure, but it\nwouldn't surprise me if his Dad were
    a coach.   He has that kind of game.\nChris Mortensen reported earlier this week
    that Drew Bledsoe may not be\ncoming back this season because of his injury.   Terry
    Glenn is a question\nmark for this week.  His agent is crying again that mean
    old Bill Belichick\nmade him hurt his hamstring.   I'm so far over that.   If
    he plays, he could\nproduce.   Troy Brown will also see a ton of looks and you
    can't count out\nMr. Do Everything, David Patten.   Denver ranks # 24 in Fantasy
    Points\nAllowed to TEs so I wouldn't be surprised to see Jermaine Wiggins make
    some\nnoise.\n\n\nNew Orleans Passing Game vs St. Louis Defense\n\nLike everyone
    else, I'm a little worried about Aaron Brooks.   He ranks just\n# 17 among QBs
    in Fantasy Points over the last 3 weeks.   Things won't get\nany easier this week
    against a vastly improved Ram defense that ranks # 13\nin Passing Yards Allowed
    Per Game over the last four weeks.   The focus of\nthe Saints is (rightly) RB
    Ricky Williams and Brooks simply isn't being\ncounted on to carry the team.   WRs
    Joe Horn and Willie Jackson are\ngarnering most of the passes with Albert Connell
    getting a few looks.   TE\nCam Cleeland is doing his Bubba Franks impression scoring
    on just about\nevery pass he catches.   The Rams rank # 17 in Fantasy Points Allowed
    to TEs\nso Cleeland might do some damage.\n\n\nPhiladelphia Passing Game vs Oakland
    Defense\n\nDonovan McNabb threw just enough to win Sunday afternoon.   He'll likely
    do\nthe same against an Oakland defense that's ranked # 20 in Passing Yards\nAllowed
    Per Game over the last four weeks.   Cornerback Charles Woodson's a\nshutdown
    corner and is as good as anyone in the game.   WR Todd Pinkston's\nwrist wasn't
    supposed to be any big deal but he's showing up on the injury\nreport as Questionable.
    \  Coach Andy Reid said he thought he'd be good to\nfor Sunday.   If Woodson lines
    up on James Thrash, Pinkston could produce.\n\n\nSan Diego Passing Game vs Buffalo
    Defense\n\nBuffalo at San Diego...Think they'll be any revenge factor brewing
    here?\nJust a little I'm guessing.   QB Doug Flutie takes his team against a\nBuffalo
    Defense that's actually been very solid against the pass ranking # 1\nin Passing
    Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   Much of that\ncan be attributed
    to games against Pittsburgh, Jacksonville, and the Jets.\nStill though, they're
    decent defending the pass and will give Flutie some\nobstacles.   Jeff Graham
    is clearly the most active WR while they're doing\nwhat they can to get TE Freddie
    Jones into the game.\n\n\nSan Francisco Passing Game vs Chicago Defense\n\nQB
    Jeff Garcia's picked up where he left off last year.   Over the last 3\nweeks,
    he's the # 1 rated QB in the league in Fantasy Points.   His 3\nrushing TDs lead
    the team.   They'll face a stout defense in Chicago that's\nbetter suited for
    stopping the run than the pass.   The Bears rank # 19 in\nPassing Yards Allowed
    Per Game over the last four weeks.   MLB Brian\nUrlacher is very tough on the
    mid range routes but look for the 49ers to\nexploit the Chicago Corners, R.W.
    McQuarters and Walt Harris.   No corner\nmatches up well with Terrell Owens and
    this week won't be any different.\nJ.J. Stokes and Tai Streets will see action
    as well but make no mistake,\nthis team is about Garcia throwing to Owens.\n\n\nWashington
    Passing Game vs New York Giants Defense\n\nTony Banks to Rod Gardner.   What a
    great performance by the rookie WR last\nweek.   It'll be tougher to repeat as
    the Giants are much more physical.\nThey rank # 12 in Passing Yards Allowed Per
    Game over the last four weeks.\nGardner has seen 7+ passes thrown his way each
    game since week 3.   Michael\nWestbrook's numbers have been falling.   Pretty
    tough matchup for the young\nGardner.\n\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\n\nDownside
    Matchups:  These games feature a Defense that could pose trouble\nfor the Offense.\n\n\nArizona
    Passing Game vs Dallas Defense\n\nThe Arizona passing game is all about David
    Boston.   And rightfully so.\nCowboy Cornerbacks Mario Edwards and Duane Hawthorne
    can't matchup with\nBoston and the Cardinal running game with Michael Pittman
    will have the\nsafeties creeping forward.   On the flip side, Dallas ranks # 5
    in Passing\nYards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks and it's hard to argue
    with\nthe numbers.   Obviously, they're stopping teams somehow.   Jake Plummer\nshould
    have time to throw as the Cowboys have only registered 5 sacks in the\nlast 3
    games.\n\n\nBuffalo Passing Game vs San Diego Defense\nIs there a light at the
    end of the tunnel for Rob Johnson?   He did play\nmuch better last week.   Before
    I get too excited, he's got a tough matchup\nthis week with San Diego who plays
    pretty decent pass defense.   Plus, you\nknow the Chargers will be pumped up playing
    the Bills with all the ties\nthere.   The Chargers rank # 14 in Passing Yards
    Allowed Per Game over the\nlast four weeks.   WR Eric Moulds, TE Jay Reimersma,
    and FB Larry Centers\nwill see the bulk of the passes from Johnson.   In an effort
    to save Rob\nJohnson's life, I think you'll continue to see the coaching staff
    rely\nheavily on the short passes to Reimersma and Centers.\n\n\nDallas Passing
    Game vs Arizona Defense\n\nWith Anthony Wright's knee troubles, looks like Dallas
    will start Clint\nStoerner or Ryan Leaf.   Ouch.   Although to be fair, I've always
    been a guy\nwho felt Leaf still has a chance in this league.   Call me crazy,
    I know.\nWR Joey Galloway is questionable with a bad foot so that's a negative.
    \  If\nWright's unable to go, I'd probably shy away from all these guys until
    you\nsee them perform.\n\n\nIndianapolis Passing Game vs Kansas City Defense\n\nIf
    you own any Colt players, you've seen first hand the differences between\nreal
    and Fantasy Football lately.   Marvin Harrison, Peyton Manning and\nEdgerrin James
    turned in great Fantasy performances last week - en route to\nthe Colts getting
    spanked by the Patriots.   Go figure.   They'll have a\npretty tough matchup this
    week against Kansas City who ranks # 2 in Passing\nYards Allowed Per Game over
    the last four weeks.    Much of that ranking\ncomes from the fact KC is so easy
    to run on.   Corners William Bartee and\nEric Warfield will have their hands full
    with Harrison and Rookie Reggie\nWayne.  Looks like WR Jerome Pathon will miss
    another game with a sprained\nfoot.   Look for the Colts to take what the Chiefs
    give them - running room\nfor James.\n\n\nJacksonville Passing Game vs Baltimore
    Defense\n\nOver the last two weeks, it's become very clear that the way to attack
    the\nRavens defense is to spread the field with multiple WR sets.   Look for\nJacksonville
    to do just that and for QB Mark Brunell to possibly focus a bit\nmore on the shorter
    passing game.   WRs Jimmy Smith and Keenan McCardell are\nboth solid players.
    \  They'll face a Raven defense that's ranked # 11 in\nPassing Yards Allowed Per
    Game over the last four weeks.   They're much more\neffective in stopping the
    run than they are the pass.   With Stacey Mack\nrushing the ball, the Jags would
    just as well throw.   TE Kyle Brady might\nbe worth a shot as Baltimore ranks
    # 26 in Fantasy Points Allowed to TEs.\n\n\nMiami Passing Game vs Seattle Defense\n\nJay
    Fiedler faces an improving Seattle defense that's ranked # 17 in Passing\nYards
    Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   Miami's had a week off to\nprepare.
    \  WRs Oronde Gadsden and our Footballguy favorite Chris Chambers\nwill see most
    of the passes although Cornerback Shawn Springs is getting\nback to form after
    his hamstring injury and will likely limit Gadsden's\nplay.\n\n\nPittsburgh Passing
    Game vs Tennessee Defense\n\nThe Steelers are rolling but don't think Kordell
    Stewart has too much to do\nwith it.   I'd avoid pretty much everyone on this
    offense outside of Jerome\nBettis and Kris Brown.   If you really have to reach,
    WR Plaxico Burress is\nseeing lots of balls thrown his way and actually has more
    targets the last\ntwo weeks than Hines Ward.   Burress should be able to use his
    size to his\nadvantage in the Red Zone.   Injured Cornerback Samari Rolle says
    he has a\n50-50 chance of playing Monday.   But bottom line is this team is all
    about\nJerome Bettis and Defense.\n\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\n\nDefensive
    Slam Dunks:  These games feature a very tough Defense posing major\nproblems for
    the Offense.\n\n\nOakland Passing Game vs Philadelphia Defense\n\nQB Rich Gannon
    and his Hall of Famers, Jerry Rice and Tim Brown will take on\none of the most
    aggressive pass defenses in the game.   Against Oakland's\nsavvy veterans, I'm
    not certain unlimited blitzing is the best course of\naction.   Brown and Rice
    are guys who can find the open seam and\nfortunately, Gannon's a guy who can deliver
    the ball.   The Eagles rank # 3\nin Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last
    four weeks though so\nsomething's gotta give.\n\n\nSeattle Passing Game vs Miami
    Defense\n\nIn one of the more controversial moves of the season, Coach Mike Holmgren\nhas
    awarded Matt Hasselbeck his job back.   Trent Dilfer goes back to the\nbench.
    \  While he's there, he'll likely see Hasselbeck struggle against a\ntough Miami
    Defense.   Miami ranks # 8 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game\nover the last four
    weeks and Cornerbacks Patrick Surtain and Sam Madison are\nas good as any pair
    in the game.\n\n\nTennessee Passing Game vs Pittsburgh Defense\n\nSteve McNair
    looked almost like a real live NFL QB last week.   Although he\nstill can't get
    the ball past his TE as Frank Wycheck rolled for 100 yards.\nLook for more of
    the same this week as the Steelers create trouble.\nPittsburgh is ranked # 4 in
    Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last\nfour weeks.   Their aggressive Linebacker
    play could create some\nopportunities for Wycheck and Erron Kinney to find some
    seams in the middle.\nAs usual, the TEs are the best options here.\n\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\nBryant

  subject: ! 'FW: Texas Monthly November 2001: How Enron Blew It'
  body: ! "\n\nLess than a year ago, the Houston-based energy behemoth had everything:
    money, power, glitz, smarts, new ideas, and a CEO who wanted to make it the most
    important company in the world. Now its stock is down, wall street is bearish,
    and the CEO is gone. What went wrong?\nby Mimi Swartz </mag/issues/authors/mimiswartz.php>\nTHE
    ENRON SKYSCRAPER NEAR THE SOUTH END OF HOUSTON'S DOWNTOWN feels like the international
    headquarters of the best and the brightest. The lobby in no way resembles the
    hushed, understated entryways of the old-fashioned oil companies, like Shell and
    Texaco nearby. Enron, in contrast, throbs with modernity. The people hustling
    in and out of the elevators are black, white, brown; Asian, Middle Eastern, European,
    African, as well as American-born. They are young, mostly under 35, and dressed
    in the aggressively casual uniform of the tech industry-the guys wear khakis,
    polo shirts, and Banana Republic button-downs. Almost preposterously fit, they
    move through the building intently, like winners. Enron is nothing if not energetic:
    A Big Brother-size TV screen frantically reports on the stock market near a bank
    of elevators, while another hefty black television relaying the same news greets
    people entering from the garage. A sculpture of the corporate symbol, an E tipped
    at a jaunty angle, radiates colors as it spins frenetically on its axis; a Starbucks
    concession on the ground floor keeps everyone properly caffeinated. Multicolored,
    inspirational flags hang from the ceiling, congratulating Enron on its diversity
    and its values; one more giant banner between elevator banks declares Enron's
    simple if grandiose goal: \"From the World's Leading Energy Company to . . . The
    World's Leading Company!\"\nFor a while, that future seemed guaranteed, as Enron
    transformed itself from a stodgy, troubled pipeline company in 1985 to a trading
    colossus in 2000. It was a Wall Street darling, with a stock price that increased
    1,700 percent in that sixteen-year period, with revenues that increased from $40
    billion to $100 billion. \"The very mention of the company in energy circles throughout
    the world creates reactions ranging from paralyzing fear to envy,\" notes a 2001
    report from Global Change Associates, a firm that provides market intelligence
    to the energy business.\nThis Enron was largely the creation of Jeff Skilling,
    a visionary determined to transform American business. Hired sixteen years ago
    as a consultant by then-CEO Ken Lay, Skilling helped build a company that disdained
    the old formula of finding energy in the ground, hauling it in pipelines, and
    then selling it to refineries and other customers. Instead, it evolved into a
    company that could trade and market energy in all its forms, from natural gas
    to electricity, from wind to water. If you had a risky drilling venture, Enron
    would fund it for a piece of the action. If you wanted your megacorporation's
    energy needs analyzed and streamlined, Enron could do the job. If you were a Third
    World country with a pitiful infrastructure and burgeoning power needs, Enron
    was there to build and build. Basically, if an idea was new and potentially-and
    fantastically-lucrative, Enron wanted the first crack. And with each success,
    Enron became ever more certain of its destiny. The company would be the bridge
    between the old economy and the high-tech world, and in February of this year,
    Skilling reaped his reward when he succeeded Lay as chief executive officer. Enron,
    says Skilling, \"was a great marriage of the risk-taking mentality of the oil
    patch with the risk-taking mentality of the financial markets.\"\nThe Enron story
    reflects the culture that drove American business at the end of the twentieth
    century. Like the high-tech companies it emulated, Enron was going to reinvent
    the American business model and, in turn, the American economy. Maybe it was natural
    that this Brave New World also produced a culture that was based on absolutes:
    not just the old versus the new, but the best versus the mediocre, the risk takers
    versus the complacent-those who could see the future versus those who could not.
    The key was investing in the right kind of intellectual capital. With the best
    and the brightest, a company couldn't possibly go wrong.\nOr could it? Today Enron's
    stock trades at around $35, down from a high of $80 in January. The press cast
    Enron as the archvillain of California's energy crisis last spring, and Skilling
    caught a blueberry pie in the face for his relentless defense of the free market.
    A long-troubled power plant project in India threatened the company's global ambitions.
    Telecommunications, in which Enron was heavily invested, imploded. Wall Street
    analysts who once touted the company questioned its accounting practices. Some
    of the change in Enron's fortunes can be attributed to the economic downturn in
    uncertain times that has afflicted all of American business. But the culture that
    the company created and lived by cannot escape blame.\nENRON, JEFF SKILLING SAYS,
    HAD \"a totally different way of thinking about business-we got it.\" At Enron,
    in fact, you either \"got it\" or you were gone-it was as simple as black and
    white. It is not coincidental, then, that the color scheme of Skilling's River
    Oaks mansion mirrors the corporation he once headed. Here, the living room's white
    walls shimmer against the mahogany floors. Black leather trims the edge of snowy
    carpets. Billowy sofas set off the jet-black baby grand. In the entry, white orchids
    cascade from a black vase on a black pedestal table that in turn pools onto cold,
    white marble. There is only one off-color note: After almost twenty years, Jeff
    Skilling is no longer associated with Enron, having resigned abruptly after just
    six months as CEO. Once, Skilling was hailed as the next Jack Welch (General Electric's
    masterful CEO), as one of Worth magazine's best CEO's in America (anointed in
    2001), and even as a daredevil who hosted the kind of unchained adventure junkets
    in which, a friend told BusinessWeek, \"someone could actually get killed.\" Today,
    he sounds more like Ebenezer Scrooge on Christmas morning. \"I had no idea what
    I'd let go of,\" Skilling says of all the personal sacrifices he made while retooling
    Enron. \nFrom a black chair in the white library, across from a huge black and
    white photograph of his daughter and two sons, Skilling clarifies. The demands
    of working 24-7 for Enron caused him to ignore his personal finances. Divorced,
    he lived in a 2,200-square-foot house without a microwave or a dishwasher. He
    almost missed his brother's wedding. \"Learning a foreign language-I never learned
    a foreign language!\" he exclaims. He never once took his youngest son to school.
    \"I'm interested in the kids. You don't do kids in fifteen-minute scheduling.\"
    Travel: \"You can't go to Africa for a week and get anything out of it!\" Skilling
    includes the study of architecture and design on his list of missed opportunities,
    then he stops and sighs. \"I'm not sure that fulfillment in life is compatible
    with a CEO's job,\" he says, finally. Then his eyes lock on mine, and his voice,
    which had softened, regains its pragmatic edge. \"It would have been easy to stay,\"
    he says. \"But that would not have been good for me.\" \nHe's a smallish, ruddy-faced
    man who keeps himself at fighting weight, handsome in the way of corporate titans,
    with piercing cheekbones and that assiduously stolid gaze. But the impatience
    Skilling once reserved for cautious underlings and dull-witted utility company
    executives is now targeted at reporters who have labeled his resignation \"bizarre\"
    and associates who are bitterly skeptical of his need for family time. His shrug
    stretches the limits of his shimmering blue button-down, and his matching blue
    eyes look put upon. \"I'm surprised,\" he says, \"that people have so much trouble
    understanding this.\"\nPEOPLE WHO PASSED THROUGH DOWNTOWN HOUSTON in the late
    eighties or early nineties couldn't help but notice a funny and, for its time,
    novel scene unfolding throughout the workday at the base of the Enron Building.
    From nine to five and before and after, you could see people slipping out of the
    pristine silver skyscraper to smoke. They perched on the chrome banisters or lurked
    near the glass doors at the entry, puffing like mad. They always looked hurried
    and furtive, even ashamed. Whatever people knew about Enron in those days (and
    most people didn't know much), it was often associated with that scene: Enron
    boasted one of the first nonsmoking corporate headquarters in Houston, and there
    couldn't have been clearer evidence of its break with the energy world of the
    past. What macho engineer would have put up with such humiliation?\nBut this company
    was a child of another time, that period in the mid-eighties when chaos enveloped
    the gas business. Federal deregulation of natural gas turned a steady, secure
    industry, in which gas pipeline companies frequently enjoyed a monopoly in portions
    of the areas that they served, into a volatile free-for-all. The situation was
    compounded five years later by federal deregulation of the pipeline business.
    So it happened that a gentlemanly gas pipeline company, Houston Natural Gas (HNG)
    found itself under attack from Coastal Corporation, Oscar Wyatt's less than gentlemanly
    firm. HNG was then run by Lay, a sturdy, taciturn former economics professor and
    Transco chief operating officer who had a passion for military strategy. (His
    doctoral thesis at the University of Houston was on supply and demand in the Vietnam
    War.) Lay, who was from Missouri and never succumbed-at least outwardly-to Texas
    brashness, had done well enough: Thanks to canny expansions, HNG's pipelines stretched
    from Florida to California and throughout the state of Texas.\nHNG fended off
    Coastal, but to protect the company from other takeover attempts, Lay nimbly engineered
    the sale of HNG in 1985 to a friendly Nebraska pipeline concern called InterNorth,
    one of the largest pipeline companies in the country at the time. Then, a funny
    thing happened: HNG started acting in a way that would characterize the company
    for years to come-a lot like Coastal. What the Nebraskans blithely labeled \"the
    purchase\" was being called \"the merger\" back in Houston, and before long, following
    some particularly brutal politicking between Omaha and Houston, the company's
    center of gravity started shifting toward Texas, and shortly after that, Ken Lay
    was running a new company called Enron. \"Over time it became clear that Lay had
    a better vision of the future,\" says one person associated with Enron at that
    time. \"He never fought change. He embraced change.\"\nLay had won, but what exactly
    did that mean? Enron was saddled with massive debt from the takeover attempt,
    and thanks to deregulation, no longer had exclusive use of its pipelines. Without
    new ideas-for that matter, a whole new business plan-the company could be finished
    before it really even got started. \nLIKE MANY PEOPLE WHO TEAMED UP WITH ENRON
    IN THE EIGHTIES, Jeff Skilling had spent a lot of time in the Midwest, and he
    was self-made-at fourteen he had been the chief production director at a start-up
    TV station in Aurora, Illinois. (His mother would drop him off there every day
    after school.) \"I liked being successful when I was working, and I was smart,\"
    he told BusinessWeek earlier this year. But unlike many of his Enron colleagues,
    Skilling wasn't deliberate and soft-spoken and happy to go home at five o'clock;
    he was anxious and excitable, and nothing, but nothing excited him more than what
    he would come to call \"intellectual capital.\" He loved being smart, and he loved
    being surrounded by smart people. He graduated from Southern Methodist University,
    went into banking-assets and liability management-and took on Harvard Business
    School, where he graduated in the top 5 percent of his class. Then Skilling took
    the next step on what was then the new, souped-up path to American success: He
    joined Manhattan's McKinsey and Company as a business consultant, and that is
    where Ken Lay found him in 1985. \nIt is often said of Lay that his instincts
    for hiring the best are flawless, and his choice of Skilling probably saved the
    company. Skilling was above all an expert at markets and how they worked. While
    everyone else was worrying about the gluts and the shortages that defined the
    gas industry, he alone saw the parallels between gas and other businesses. And
    so in a world where credit was nearly impossible to come by, Skilling came up
    with what he called the Gas Bank, which contractually guaranteed both the supply
    and the price of gas to a network of suppliers and consumers. Enron would not
    be a broker but a banker. It would buy and sell the gas itself and assume the
    risk involved. And Enron would make money on transactions, much like an investment
    bank would.\nSkilling worked up some numbers and found them \"absolutely compelling.\"
    Then the McKinsey consultant took the idea to a meeting of about 25 Enron executives.
    He had a one-page presentation. \"Almost to a person,\" Skilling says, \"they
    thought it was stupid.\" Almost. After Skilling left the meeting dejected, he
    walked Ken Lay to an elevator and apologized. Lay listened and then said, \"Let's
    go.\"\nThe Gas Bank was not an overnight success. For months Skilling woke up
    in a cold sweat, sure he had ruined not only his career but the careers of dozens
    of colleagues who had assisted him. In fact, he had come upon one of those divides
    that seem to define his life: \"I believed this whole world would be different,
    a huge breakthrough\" is the way Skilling puts it today, and even if he is typically
    immodest, he was right. Fairly soon after launching, the company sold $800 million
    worth of gas in a week. True to Skilling's character, success turned out to be
    a matter of old versus new: He says the joke around Enron was that if a company's
    CEO was under fifty, \"We were in.\" And he was in too: In 1990 Skilling finally
    left McKinsey and joined Enron as the head of Enron Finance Corporation, a new
    division created just for him. In 1991 that company closed a deal that earned
    $11 million in profit. After that, says Skilling, \"we never looked back.\"\nSkilling
    and Lay also realized that the Gas Bank couldn't work unless it had a trading
    component. Myriad trades were needed to build the market that would make the project
    go. But by buying and selling enormous quantities of gas, Enron not only constructed
    a market but almost instantly came to dominate it. The company had the best contacts,
    the best intelligence, and the best access to supplies. That, in turn, attracted
    more customers who wanted to be part of the play. With so many customers in its
    pocket, Enron could better predict the direction of the market and could use that
    knowledge to make trades for its own benefit-Enron could in effect bet on which
    way the price of gas would go, as one might do with pork bellies or soybeans,
    but with startling accuracy, thereby generating profits higher than anyone could
    have ever imagined.\nTHIS CHANGE COULD NEVER HAVE OCCURRED without another change
    Skilling had made: He created, within Enron, a new culture to match its new trading
    business. The idea was to build a \"knowledge-based business,\" which demanded
    a skill set not exactly prized by Enron's employees from the old HNG days. Most
    were deliberate, cautious, responsible, somewhat defensive people, most of them
    men, of course-the kind of people you'd expect to find working in an industry
    regulated by the federal government. But now the company needed bolder people
    for its bold new era: that included anyone who wanted to make money-lots of money-for
    themselves and for the company. \"Enron was going to create a niche for itself
    or die,\" one former executive explains. \"The people who had narrow views eventually
    were forced out, because if they had narrow views about other things, they had
    narrow views about the market.\"\nSkilling wanted smart people but not just any
    smart people. He wanted the smartest people from schools like Harvard, Stanford,
    and maybe, Rice. And because his firm was now acting more like a bank than a pipeline
    company, he wanted to draw from the pool of recruits that would be attracted to
    the biggest and best investment banks, like Merrill Lynch or Credit Suisse First
    Boston. In addition to being smart, Enron people were also supposed to be \"aggressive.\"
    You were right for Enron if you didn't want to wait until you were thirty to close
    your own deals or move up in an organization. \nYou could see what he was looking
    for on \"Super Saturdays\" at the Houston headquarters: eight fifty-minute interviews
    with ten minute breaks in between-the company might herd as many as four hundred
    people through in just one day. They were scored from 1 to 5 on their smarts,
    their problem-solving ability, their passion for hard work, and what at Enron
    was called \"a sense of urgency.\" People who scored less than 2.5 were scratched.
    The shrewdest candidates knew how to work Enron before they were even hired: These
    were the types that automatically turned down the company's first offer, knowing
    Enron would come back with more. The starting salary was around $80,000. Maybe
    it wasn't a fortune-yet-but the signing bonus, about $20,000, was more than enough
    for a lease on the obligatory Porsche Boxster or one of the lofts being renovated
    close to downtown. (Enron people didn't live in far-flung suburbs. Suburbs were
    uncool and too far from the office.)\nFor the lucky winners, Enron offered the
    corporate equivalent of a gifted-and-talented program. New associates learned
    the latest techniques for structuring energy deals, and there were rotations at
    Enron offices around the globe. The hours were long, but every possible need was
    taken care of. A company concierge handled all the things important people couldn't
    be bothered with: picking up dry cleaning or prescriptions, shining shoes, cleaning
    the house, planning a vacation. Of course, a lot of people who worked for Enron
    never got to take vacations-they were too busy making money-but they could use
    the company gym and the company's personal trainers. If they were overweight or
    wanted to quit smoking, they could join Enron's Wellness Program. Massages were
    offered six days a week, from seven in the morning until ten at night. \"They
    were so cutting edge,\" rhapsodizes someone involved with the company health care
    program at the time. \"They really thought about the psychology and what it took
    to keep these people going.\"\nSkilling handed out titles analogous to those at
    Wall Street firms-analysts, associates, directors, and managing directors-but
    everyone knew that those titles didn't really matter. Money did. Instead of competitive
    salaries and decent bonuses, Enron offered competitive salaries and merit-based
    bonuses-with no cap. \"If you really worked hard and delivered results, you could
    make a lot of money,\" says Ken Rice, who stayed with Enron for 21 years until
    resigning recently as the head of the company's faltering broadband division.
    Or, as the saying goes, you got to eat what you killed. Gas traders with two or
    three years of experience could wind up with a $1 million bonus. And the more
    you produced, the closer you got to Jeff: Real hot dogs joined him glacier hiking
    in Patagonia, Land Cruiser racing in Australia, or off-road motorcycling in a
    re-creation of the Baja 1,000 race, ending at a spectacular Mexican villa. \"Every
    time he'd speak, I'd believe everything he'd say,\" one loyalist says. \nAnd why
    not? By 1995 Enron had become North America's largest natural-gas merchant, controlling
    20 percent of the market. But at a company where the buzzword was \"aggressive,\"
    that was no place to stop: Skilling and Lay believed the Gas Bank model could
    easily be applied to the electricity business. Firmly committed to the notion
    that a deregulated market meant better service at lower prices for consumers (and
    untold profits for Enron), they began barnstorming the country, pressing their
    case with entrenched power company presidents (who, with their multimillion-dollar
    salaries and monopoly service areas, had little incentive to change) and energy
    regulators (who were somewhat more receptive, thanks in part to Enron's generous
    lobbying efforts).\nBut the biggest winner of all was probably Jeff Skilling.
    In 1997 Ken Lay made him the president and chief operating officer of the company.
    By then, the division known as Enron Capital and Trade Resources was the nations
    largest wholesale buyer and seller of natural gas and electricity. The division
    had grown from two hundred to two thousand employees, and revenues from $2 billion
    to $7 billion. \"Mr. Skilling's experience so far with the turmoil in the industry
    has convinced him that he is on the right track,\" the New York Times noted. Everyone
    would certainly have thought so: Enron and Skilling had totally transformed one
    industry and were well on their way to transforming another.\n\"FIRING UP AN IDEA
    MACHINE; Enron Is Encouraging the Entrepreneurs Within,\" sang the New York Times
    in 1999. \"In the staid world of regulated utilities and energy companies, Enron
    Corp is that gate-crashing Elvis,\" crowed Fortune in 2000. Wall Street was demanding
    tech-size growth on a tech timetable, and Enron, in 2000, obliged with second
    quarter earnings of $289 million, up 30 percent from the previous year. That year
    the company seemed to discover a market a minute: Under Skilling, Enron was trading
    coal, paper, steel, and even weather. No one blinked when a London wine bar became
    an Enron client. People drank more in warm weather than cold, so why not buy a
    hedge against the usual winter downturn?\nBut most exciting to the financial world
    was Enron's entry into high-tech communications. Because of the company's marketing
    dominance, EnronOnline became another overnight success, handling $335 billion
    in commodity trades online in 2000. Enron, as usual, made its money on the spread
    between the bid price and the asking price. Then there was the broadband business:
    To Enron, trading excess capacity in large, high-speed fiber-optic networks (empty
    lanes on the fabled information highway) wasn't that different from trading the
    capacity of natural gas pipelines. So Enron created a market for what the industry
    calls bandwidth. Soon after, it also announced a twenty-year deal with Blockbuster
    to deliver movies on demand electronically to people in their homes. Enron looked
    like a company that couldn't lose. \"Its strategy of building businesses, shedding
    hard assets, and trading various commodities can help it do well even in an uncertain
    market,\" BusinessWeek insisted.\nThere was, however, another reason Enron did
    so well in such a short time: the company's hard-nosed approach toward its customers.
    The old notion of customer service was based on the long haul-you had to nurse
    and coddle customers to keep them. But Enron had new markets and new ideas-customers
    had to come to it. Over time, the company stopping referring to its business clients
    as customers and began calling them \"counterparties.\"\nSkilling wanted the biggest
    profits on the shortest timetable: Gains were maximized by creating, owning, and
    then abandoning a market before it became overtaxed and overregulated. So if you
    wanted to launch a high-risk venture quickly-such as Zilkha Energy's new high-tech
    approach to drilling for oil-you got your financing from Enron because a bank
    would take forever to underwrite the project, if it ever would. But because Enron
    invented its markets and subsequently dominated them, Enron could set the terms
    of its deals, from the timeline to the method of accounting to whether the deal
    happened at all. \nWhile many businesses used what was known in the industry as
    \"mark-to-market accounting,\" for instance, Enron used it on an unprecedented
    scale. The company priced their deals at current market value-but it was always
    Enron's idea of the market value; companies that balked at their pricing didn't
    get deals. And while old-fashioned companies spread their profits out like annuities
    over a period of years, Enron took most of its profit up-front. However many millions
    would be made on a deal that covered several years, they went on the books in
    the current year. If a few analysts thought there might be something fishy about
    what they called \"subjective accounting,\" investors didn't particularly care
    as long as the profits rolled in. As the market fluctuated and the landscape changed,
    the company might abandon a project that had been in the works for months because
    its profit margins weren't going to be high enough. \"Enron is known for leaving
    people at the altar,\" says one former employee. Winning the highest possible
    profits for the company could even extend to Enron's attitude toward charity.
    When a fundraiser for the Houston READ Commission, a literacy group, called on
    Enron for a contribution, it was suggested that he start raising money for Enron's
    competing literacy charity: \"Even the person who was supposed to give money away
    for Enron was supposed to make money for Enron,\" he says.\nAs Enron became more
    and more successful, the culture Skilling had created took on a dark side: The
    competition turned inward. As one member of the Enron family put it, \"It became
    a company full of mercenaries.\" The change started at the bottom. As Enron's
    domination of the energy market grew, most of the recruiting frills fell away.
    New associates were treated much like the commodities the company traded. Global
    Change's Enron spies reported overhearing orders like \"I need a smart person-go
    buy me one\" or \"Buy me an intelligent slave, quick.\" Enron had never been the
    kind of place where people sang to you on your birthday, but now the workaholism
    bordered on self-parody: A Random Acts of Kindness program lasted only a few months.
    It was too disruptive. People couldn't get their work done.\nAnd, of course, Enron
    had a program for institutionalizing creative tension. The Performance Review
    Committee, which had initially been installed by Skilling in the Capital group,
    became known as the harshest forced ranking system in the country. Employees were
    rated on a scale of one to five, and those with fives were usually gone within
    six months. (The PRC's nickname quickly became \"rank and yank.\") It was a point
    of pride that Skilling's division replaced 15 percent of its workforce every year.
    As one Skilling associate put it, \"Jeff viewed this like turning over the inventory
    in a grocery store.\" Skilling's approach to business-get in and get out-had become
    Enron's attitude toward its workers. In time, it would become many workers' attitude
    toward the company. Teamwork, never that valuable in a trading culture, went the
    way of the eyeshade and the abacus. If protocol required an Enron higher-up to
    come from Europe to help with a project in the Third World, he might help-or he
    might not, depending on whether another, potentially more lucrative project was
    pending elsewhere.\nEveryone felt the pressure to perform on a massive scale at
    massive speed: \"They were so goal oriented toward immediate gratification that
    they lost sight of the future,\" says one former employee. Anyone who couldn't
    close deals within a quarter was punished with bad PRC scores, as were the higher-ups
    who had backed them. Past errors and old grudges were dredged up so often as new
    ammunition in PRC meetings that the phrase \"No old tapes\" became an Enron clich?.
    \"People went from being geniuses to idiots overnight,\" says one former Enron
    executive.\nIn such a hothouse, paranoia flowered. New contracts contained highly
    restrictive confidentiality agreements about anything pertaining to the company.
    E-mail was monitored. A former executive routinely carried two laptops, one for
    the company and one for himself. People may have been rich at Enron, but they
    weren't necessarily happy. One recruiter described the culture this way: \"They
    roll you over and slit your throat and watch your eyes while you bleed to death.\"\nBEFORE
    JEFF SKILLING COULD TRANSFORM ENRON from the world's leading energy company into
    the world's leading company, he had to make one more change: Just as he had done
    ten years before, Skilling had to purge the company of its remaining old order.
    Where Enron once prized cautious executives who dealt with tangible assets like
    pipelines, it now valued bold executives who dealt with intangible assets. Pipelines,
    power plants-they may have been Enron's pride, but Skilling wanted them gone.
    Expensive, long-term building projects had no place when Wall Street was devoted
    to quick profits and enormous returns on investment capital, and Skilling knew
    it. \"It wasn't the time for long-term approaches,\" an Enron executive says of
    Wall Street's mood. \"It was the technology era.\"\nTo rid Enron of the last vestiges
    of its past, Skilling had to take on Rebecca Mark, long considered his rival for
    the CEO's job. Mark was for many years the poster child for the Enron way: Young,
    attractive, aggressive-her nickname was Mark the Shark-she came from sturdy Midwestern
    stock but had the requisite Harvard MBA. Mark was largely responsible for the
    success of Enron International, the asset-heavy side of the company where she
    developed $20 billion worth of gas and power plants, which accounted for 40 percent
    of Enron's profits in 1998. For this she reaped breathtaking compensation-one
    Enron executive estimated $10 million-and adoring press clips, including two appearances
    on Fortune's list of the fifty most powerful women in corporate America.\nBut
    then Mark ran into trouble with a gas-fired power plant in Dabhol, India, one
    of the largest ever constructed. She had played the game the Enron way: Taking
    Enron into a new market, she had finagled low import taxes (20 percent instead
    of the usual 53) and hung in through 24 lawsuits and three changes in government.
    But the time and expense needed to make India and other Enron plants around the
    globe successful did not mesh with Enron's goals, and Skilling's impatience with
    Mark grew.\nForcing Mark out, however, was no easy matter. Key executives left,
    divisions were dismantled, but she remained. The truth was Enron didn't mind firing
    lower-level employees, but it hated to fire the kind of aggressive, relentless
    people it tended to promote. The company preferred humiliation-keeping a director
    in his cubicle, say, but failing to include him in the glamour deals, or kicking
    someone upstairs with a fancy title. (One particularly difficult executive won
    a few years at graduate school, gratis.) A company as smart as Enron could probably
    deduce too that dispatching one of the most visible businesswomen in the country
    would provoke a public-relations disaster. So Lay and Skilling did something classically
    Enronian: They gave Mark her own company. Despite Skilling's contempt for asset-heavy
    businesses, Enron spent more than $2 billion to buy a run-of-the-mill British
    water utility that could serve as Enron's entry into the emerging world of water
    privatization. Mark was put in charge of making Enron, yes, the world's greatest
    water company. Azurix, as the new business was called, looked like another sure
    thing: Its IPO in 1999 raised $695 million. \nBut Mark had to succeed on Enron's
    increasingly abbreviated timetable in a business fraught with political and emotional
    complexities. Water is not like gas or electricity-owners and governments are
    a lot less willing to give it up, even for lots of money. The company stumbled,
    layoffs commenced, and confidence evaporated. By August 2000 the stock price,
    which had started out at $19, had fallen to $5. Mark's resignation followed, and
    Azurix, much diminished, was folded into Enron. \"I think it's best for Rebecca
    to start afresh,\" Lay, who had been a mentor to Mark, told the Wall Street Journal.
    Or as one critic put it, \"They were more interested in destroying the old culture
    than running a business.\" \nAs 2000 drew to a close, Skilling was in total command.
    In December Ken Lay announced the inevitable: \"The best time for the succession
    to occur is when the company is doing well,\" he told the press. \"Enron is doing
    extremely well now.\" In February 2001 Jeff Skilling took over the CEO's job.\nALMOST
    IMMEDIATELY THE TROUBLE STARTED. Enron's domination of the electric-power market
    made it an instant target in the California deregulation debacle. Both PBS's Frontline
    and the New York Times took on Enron, portraying the company as a heartless colossus
    that used its influence in Washington (Lay and Enron's political action committee
    are the top contributors to George W. Bush) to force old people on fixed incomes
    to choose between buying food or electricity. Skilling and Lay appeared on camera
    singing belligerent anthems to the free market, while another memorable scene
    juxtaposed one of the company's jackallike traders against a hapless state employee
    in California, as both tried to buy power online. The Times reported that Lay
    had tried to persuade a new federal commissioner to change his views on energy
    deregulation. The bad press was, to say the least, ironic: Just as the media was
    pounding Enron for its omnipotence, Wall Street was discovering its weaknesses.
    By late March the stock price had slid to $50 a share from $80 in January.\nWithin
    Enron, the asset-based divisions took the rap for the decline. (The India plant
    continued to be enormously costly, at least in part because of constant turnover
    within Enron's management team.) But the California situation was more visible
    and therefore more damaging, despite Enron's claim that the state had never built
    enough power plants to service its population and never properly managed those
    it had. \"For three months Gray Davis did a very good job of blaming us,\" says
    Mark Palmer, a vice president for corporate communications. \"We were a Texas
    company. There was a Texan in the White House. California was a state that didn't
    put him in office, and his biggest contributor was a Texas energy company. Performance
    is going to take care of our stock price. The truth will take care of Gray Davis.\"
    (California utilities still owe Enron $500 million, another reason stockholders
    might be panicky.) But more problematic than the crisis itself was Skilling's
    all too apparent lack of contrition. Facing down his critics, he cracked a joke
    comparing California with the Titanic. (\"At least the Titanic went down with
    its lights on.\")\nBut the biggest problem was Enron's telecommunications division,
    which had been responsible for at least one third of its heady stock price. Investors
    believed that Enron could revolutionize high-speed communications, just as it
    had revolutionized gas and power. Enron estimated the global market for buying
    and selling space over fiber-optic cable would grow from $155 billion in 2001
    to $383 billion by 2004-but then the tech bubble burst. So too did the much-hyped
    movies-on-demand deal with Blockbuster. For the first time in its confoundingly
    successful life, Enron had nothing new to take to market. Like the popular high
    school girl who suddenly packs on a few pounds, Enron suddenly looked less alluring
    to Wall Street.\nSkilling launched a campaign to keep Enron's most important cheerleaders,
    the stock analysts, in the tent, but he wasn't cut out to be a supplicant. During
    the reporting of first quarter profits, he called an analyst who challenged Enron's
    financial reporting an \"asshole.\" When the company reported hefty second quarter
    profits, many analysts questioned whether those profits had come from the generation
    of new business or from the sale of old assets. Ignoring the growing chorus critical
    of Enron's accounting, Skilling promised, as he always had, that innovations were
    just around the corner. \"There wasn't any positive news,\" Carol Coale, of Prudential
    Financial, says now. \"Basically, he talked me out of a downgrade.\"\nThe business
    press, so generous in the past, turned surly. Fortune had asked in March whether
    Enron was overpriced. (\"Start with a pretty straightforward question: How exactly
    does Enron make its money?\") The routine cashing in of stock options that were
    about to expire by key executives was portrayed in the media as a fire sale. (Skilling
    had sold $33 million worth, Ken Lay and Ken Rice close to four times that amount.)
    Then the Wall Street Journal reported on a fund run by the CFO that had been a
    source of strife within the company. (It was essentially risk management against
    Enron's possible failures.) Every negative story seemed to produce a concurrent
    drop in the stock price: By late August it had fallen below $40. Enron, so institutionally
    unforgiving, finally got a taste of its own medicine. \"When Wall Street is in
    love with a stock, they're forgiving of something like accounting,\" says Carol
    Coale. \"When a company falls out of favor, all these issues carry more weight.\"\nThis
    fact was not lost on people inside the company, who suddenly started experiencing
    an attack of conscience. Those who had looked the other way as the most powerful
    Enron executives dumped their wives and married their secretaries or carried on
    flagrant interoffice affairs now saw the error of their ways. \"It just created
    an attitude,\" one executive still at Enron says. \"If senior people are doing
    that, why are we held to a higher standard? There was a real culture of 'We're
    above everyone else.'\" \nLoyalty had never been prized at Enron, so there was
    no reason to expect it now. An old-fashioned, slow-moving company like Exxon could
    demand hardship duty in Baku with the promise of greater rewards down the road.
    \"But,\" as one Houston oilman explains, \"if you have to negotiate a hardship
    duty with someone who doesn't have loyalty and has money, then you have a corporation
    that's better suited for good times than bad.\"\nAs it turned out, that description
    applied to Jeff Skilling too. As the stock price stubbornly refused to ascend,
    he made no secret of his unhappiness and frustration. Then, after a trip to visit
    the families of three employees killed at a plant in England, he had an epiphany:
    Life was short; for him, Enron was over. Ever stoic, Ken Lay returned to the CEO's
    office, named a new president, arranged a trip to New York to calm analysts and
    investors, and promised a kinder, gentler Enron in the future. Trading anything
    and everything was out. The company, Lay says, will still innovate but \"innovate
    much closer to our core.\" As for the culture: \"Things like the Performance Review
    Committee, I think we could have applied better. By trying to categorize people
    into so many different categories, you ended up creating a morale problem.\"\nThat
    Skilling's supposedly brilliant colleagues were as shocked at the news of his
    departure as the rest of the business community may be testament to their lack
    of emotional intelligence. Despite Skilling's lengthy tenure with Enron, he'd
    always been contemptuous of the long haul; he'd always believed in cutting losses
    and moving on. But now that he was abandoning them when the company was in trouble,
    it was different. \"Even Jeff's biggest detractors wouldn't have wanted him to
    walk out the door,\" one loyalist admits.\nBut on the day we meet, Skilling is
    looking forward, not back. \"Look,\" he says with finality, \"ninety percent of
    my net worth is in Enron. Were my interests aligned with the shareholders? Absolutely.\"\nFree
    of falling stock prices and shareholder pressures, he is nestling himself back
    into the world of ideas. His eyes flash as he talks about new technologies. \"The
    first wave never gets it right,\" he says. \"The stand-alone dot-coms didn't work,
    but the technological applications will create a second wave that will change
    the world.\" Houston, he promises, will become the world's center of commodity
    trading, and he intends to be a part of it. In fact, he is already shopping for
    office space.\n\"This is the second wave, and Enron's got it,\" he says, almost
    breathless. \"There are thousands of people running around the streets of Houston
    that get it.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n"

    Plan
  body: ! "\nIf you are a participant in the Enron Corp. Savings Plan, please read
    this very important message.\n\nWe understand that you are concerned about the
    timing of the move to a new Savings Plan administrator and the restricted access
    to your investment funds during the upcoming transition period scheduled to take
    place beginning at 3:00PM CST on October 26 and ending at 8:00AM CST on November
    20.  \n\nWe have been working with Hewitt and Northern Trust since July.  We understand
    your concerns and are committed to making this transition period as short as possible
    without jeopardizing the reconciliation of both the Plan in total or your account
    in particular.  \n\nRemember that the Enron Corp. Savings Plan is an investment
    vehicle for your long-term financial goals.  The Enron plan will continue to offer
    a variety of investment opportunities with different levels of risk.  \n\nAs always,
    we advise you to review your overall investment strategy and carefully weigh the
    potential earnings of each investment choice against its risk before making investment
    decisions that are aligned with your long-term financial plans and your risk tolerance.
    \n\nFor that reason, it is critical that ALL trades among your investment funds
    be completed by 3:00 PM CST Friday, October 26 before the transition period begins."

    I wouldn't say I'm 100 percent but I'm darn close.\" Stokes has been less than
    mediocre, however, so don't use him as a regular starter unless he proves himself

  subject: ! '[Footballguys] Update # 131 Week 7 Upgrade - Downgrade'
  body: ! "Hi Folks,\n\nAnother wild week in the NFL.   We've got Footballguy Scott
    Luebke's Week 7\nUpgrade - Downgrade - Waiver Wire Picks.\n\nBefore we get to
    that though, let me throw out something I posted today on\nour message boards
    regarding owners who beat themselves up second guessing\nthemselves.   This season
    has been as tough to predict as any in recent\nmemory and I thought this might
    be something some of you might need to hear.\n\nFrom our Message Boards www.footballguystalk.com\n\nOne
    of our message board members was (justifiably) frustrated with watching\nTrung
    Canidate blow up on his bench while Ahman Green and Ricky Williams\nfared less
    well as his starters.\n\nMy reply to him:\n\nDon't be down on yourself.   That's
    the nature of the game.   There is no\nway you bench Ricky Williams or Ahman Green
    for Canidate when Canidate was\nsuch a question mark last week.   You did what
    just about every one of us\nwould have done I'm guessing.\n\nIt's part of the
    game.   Is it frustrating?   Sure it is.   But it's still\npart of the game.   In
    my local league last week, I took a chance again on\nAntonio Freeman after starting
    him for the first few weeks (but not week 5 -\nAargh... )   Did it play out?   No,
    it didn't.   I had guys on my bench who\noutscored him.   But looking back on
    everything I knew with Minnesota and\nBilly Schroeder, it was the right call for
    me.\n\nI learned a long time ago the secret to Fantasy Football.   You just have
    to\ntake the best info you can assemble, make your call and let the players do\nthe
    rest.   Just like a real GM.   You can only do so much.\n\nIf you got beat because
    you didn't know Terry Glenn was out and you started\nhim, well, that's your bad.
    \  But if you got beat because Trung Canidate\ndecided to play the game of his
    life, and proven RBs Williams and Green did\nnot, well, that's not your fault.\n\nI
    promise you, if you can predict things to that degree, you need to quit\nyour
    job and head to Vegas.\n\nControl what you can control.   Bust your butt to know
    all you can know.\nMake the best decisions you can make and be comfortable you've
    done all you\ncan do.   After that, just enjoy the games.   Trust me, you'll be
    a better\nowner because of it.\n\nOk, let's jump to Scott's report for this week.\n\nHave
    a great week, everyone.\n\nJoe\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\n\nUpgrades\n\n\nQB
    - Tom Brady (Waiver Wire) - 5 touchdown passes in the last 2 weeks\ndeserves an
    upgrade in my book.  More importantly, Brady has yet to throw an\ninterception
    this season.  When Bledsoe returns from injury, the Patriots'\ncoaching staff
    will have a very difficult decision to make.   There's even\nsome talk that Bledsoe
    might not return this season.   Right now, Brady\ndeserves a pickup by any fantasy
    team needing a quarterback.\n\nQB - Tim Couch - The yardage numbers won't win
    any awards, but the 4\ntouchdowns in the last 2 games is impressive.  Couch is
    starting to show\nsigns of becoming a very good quarterback in this league.  Keep
    in mind, a\ntough schedule looms ahead for Couch.  However, with the Browns offense\nimproving,
    he should be considered a top quarterback for teams in a keeper\nleague looking
    towards the future.\n\nQB - Doug Flutie - The Flutie magic continues to strike.
    \ He's not the best\nfantasy quarterback, but numerous fantasy teams can be aided
    by inserting\nFlutie into the lineup.  With Curtis Conway and Jeff Graham staying
    healthy,\nFlutie should be considered a top 15 quarterback this season.  With
    a strong\nrushing game keeping defenses honest, look for Flutie to post numbers\nsimilar
    to Sunday on occasion.  280 passing yards and 2 scores is\nrespectable against
    a tough Denver defense.\n\nRB - Anthony Thomas -The A-Train continues to ride
    into fantasy starting\nlineups.  We've been hyping him for weeks and it appears
    he'll be named the\nofficial starter in Chicago shortly.  With 188 yards and a
    touchdown on\nSunday, can the Bears afford to keep him out of the lineup?  I think
    not.\n\nRB - Trung Canidate - Faulk owners need not worry about using Canidate
    as a\nfiller.  232 total yards and 2 touchdowns...WOW!   At the very least he'll\nsee
    more action even when Faulk is back.\n\nRB - Jerome Bettis - Bettis has rolled
    to 4 consecutive 100-yard games.\nLook for this trend to continue.  With the Steelers
    defense playing\nexcellent and Kordell Stewart limiting turnovers, look for Bettis
    to have\nmore good games as the season progresses.\n\nRB - Michael Pittman - We
    told you to jump off the Thomas Jones bandwagon\nand hop on the Pittman express
    earlier in the season.   With Pittman seeing\n80% of the carries and more importantly
    producing, all looks good for\nPittman owners.  I've never been an advocate of
    starting Cardinals' running\nbacks though.  After his 137 total yards and a touchdown
    performance, now\nmay be the time to deal Pittman.\n\nRB - Jason Brookins (Waiver
    Wire) - Terry Allen's ankle sprain may be all\nBrookins needs to become the team's
    starting running back.  He's looked good\nrunning behind a pretty solid offensive
    line, but his carries have been\nlimited due to Allen's presence.  Keep in mind,
    the Ravens are contacting\nother teams about trading for another back prior to
    the trade deadline.\nRight now, Brookins is a solid waiver wire choice.\n\nWR
    - David Patten (Waiver Wire) - Anyone who rushes, passes and receives for\na touchdown
    in the same game deserves an upgrade.  With Terry Glenn being\nbothered by a hamstring
    injury, Patten made the most of his opportunity.  He\nhas looked good over the
    last few weeks and has shown the ability to make\nplays, which is needed in the
    Patriots offense.  Grab him, if you are in\nneed of a receiver.\n\nWR - David
    Terrell (Waiver Wire) - Terrell had a breakout game on Sunday\nwith 7 catches
    for 91 yards.  More importantly for his fantasy value, Marcus\nRobinson suffered
    a serious knee injury and is lost for the season.  The\nRobinson injury makes
    way for Terrell to enter the Bears' starting lineup.\nIf you're in need of a receiver,
    Terrell is the best option in the free\nagent market, if he is still available.\n\nWR
    - Keyshawn Johnson - Johnson has yet to score a touchdown this season,\nbut he
    is doing everything else.  Johnson is averaging 8 catches/game and\nappears unstoppable
    at times.  However, he did suffer a hip flexor injury\nlate in the game and appears
    questionable for this week's game.\n\nWR - Johnnie Morton - Morton continues to
    impress this season.  He has\nsurpassed the 100-yard mark 3 times this season
    and scored 3 touchdowns.\nWith Germane Crowell and Herman Moore out for the season,
    Morton becomes the\nteam's #1 wide receiver.  Morton owners should be happy.\n\nWR
    - David Boston - Plain and simple, Boston is bigger, faster and better\nthan any
    defensive back on the field.  In his first 5 games, Boston is\naveraging 96 receiving
    yards/game.  Keep him in your lineup every week.\n\nWR - Jeff Graham - With the
    San Diego running game and LaDainian Tomlinson\ngarnering a lot of attention,
    the receiving corps is able to see plenty of\nopen spaces downfield.  Graham scored
    his first two touchdowns of the season\nand gained 107 yards on Sunday.  With
    defenses focusing on Tomlinson, look\nfor Flutie to find Graham for 5-6 more touchdown
    passes this season.\n\nWR - Rod Gardner (Waiver Wire) - While Michael Westbrook
    appears invisible,\nGardner is impressing on the other side of the field.  208
    yards and a\ntouchdown (with another score called back), Gardner is starting to
    claim the\ntitle of \"best rookie receiver\".  Grab him, if he is available in
    your\nleague.  Gardner is the lone bright spot in the Redskins passing game.\n\nTE
    - Bubba Franks - Franks has been diagnosed with Cris Carter disease\nbecause \"All
    he does is catch touchdowns\".  6 touchdowns in 6 games.  If\nonly he can start
    picking up yardage points.\n\nTE - Cam Cleeland - Cleeland scored another touchdown
    on Sunday to increase\nthe total to 4 scores this season.  With Aaron Brooks struggling
    to find his\nwide receivers in the red zone, Cleeland's value should remain high
    for a\nlittle while longer.\n\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\n\nDowngrades\n\n\nQB
    - Aaron Brooks - Brooks has been struggling trying to find his receivers,\nespecially
    in the red zone.  With just 4 touchdowns in his last 4 games,\nBrooks is in a
    minor slump.  There's no need to jump off his bandwagon.  On\nthe flip side, an
    upturn in production is possible over the next 4 weeks as\nNew Orleans faces:
    St. Louis, NY Jets, San Francisco and Indianapolis.  But\nfor now, we're a little
    worried and Brooks needs to be downgraded with our\nfingers crossed to see him
    upgraded starting next week.\n\nQB - Elvis Grbac - Two injuries in two weeks have
    Grbac downgraded once\nagain this week.  Without a consistent running game, look
    for Grbac's\nstruggles to continue.  For now, Grbac is expected to be listed as\nquestionable
    for this week's game against Jacksonville.\n\nQB - Charlie Batch - With 338 yards
    and 3 touchdowns, many would think that\nBatch deserves an upgrade.  Well, if
    the box scores were the only thing\nstudied, this would be the case.  However,
    the season ending injury to\nBatch's #1 receiving option, Germane Crowell, gives
    Batch a downgrade in my\nbook.  With both Crowell and Herman Moore out for the
    season, Batch must\nrely on Johnnie Morton and Larry Foster as his starting receivers...not
    a\ngood sign.\n\nQB - Vinny Testaverde - Testaverde was unable to get anything
    going against\nthe Rams on Sunday.  With the Rams leading by a significant margin,\nTestaverde
    was benched in order to get Chad Pennington some playing time.\nAll in all, not
    a good sign for Testaverde owners.  Testaverde's yardage\nnumbers are poor this
    season.  However, he has thrown for multiple\ntouchdowns in 3 of his 6 games this
    season.\n\nRB - Warrick Dunn - Dunn suffered a hamstring strain on Sunday against
    the\nSteelers.  Look for Dunn to be listed as questionable on the injury report\nthis
    week.  With the Vikings mediocre defense coming to town, Dunn's owners\ncan't
    be very happy with this recent turn of events.  Joe's email updates\nwill keep
    you posted on the latest Dunn news.\n\nRB - Michael Bennett - Chapman was able
    to rush for 90 yards on 22 carries\nduring Sunday's game versus Green Bay.  This
    is bad news for the\nunproductive, injured Bennett.  With Bennett failing to clear
    the 60-yard\nmark this season, his starting job is in jeopardy.  Keep an eye on
    this\nsituation.\n\nRB - James Stewart - Stewart suffered an ankle sprain in Sunday's
    loss to\nthe Titans.  He was limited to 17 yards on 9 carries before leaving the\ngame.
    \ Expect him to be listed as questionable for this week's game.  As\nmore of a
    straight ahead runner, Stewart may be able to play on the injury\nand be somewhat
    effective.  With this week's game on astroturf, the Lions\nmay decide to rest
    Stewart and get him back to 100% health.  Regardless, any\nkind of injury to an
    often injured player deserves a downgrade.\n\nRB - Tim Biakabatuka - Biakabatuka
    suffered a broken foot and is lost for\nthe season.\n\nRB - Terry Allen - Allen
    was limited to 12 yards on 3 carries after\nsuffering an ankle injury on Sunday.
    \ Backup Jason Brookins replaced Allen\nand looked decent.  If Allen misses any
    action, Brookins may replace him as\nthe team's starter with one good performance.
    \ The Ravens are exploring\ntrade options for another running back prior to the
    trade deadline, so the\nRavens RB situation is cloudy at the current time.\n\nRB
    - James Allen - We've been hyping Anthony Thomas for weeks and it appears\nhe
    will soon be named the official starting RB in Chicago.  Plain and\nsimple, Allen
    has been horrible this season.  With Thomas gaining 188 yards\non 22 carries,
    Allen will be relegated to spot duty.\n\nRB - LaDainian Tomlinson - Tomlinson
    was limited to 58 yards on 25 carries\nand 0 touchdowns against a stingy Broncos
    defense.  It was bound to happen\nthat a team would shut down Tomlinson.  Tomlinson
    owners should be happy\nthat he received 25 carries despite being ineffective.
    \ Just a slight\ndowngrade to show he's human.  Keep him in your lineup.\n\nWR
    - Marcus Robinson - Robinson suffered a torn ACL and MCL and is lost for\nthe
    season.\n\nWR - Germane Crowell - Crowell suffered a torn patella tendon and is
    lost\nfor the season.\n\nWR - Terry Glenn - Currently, Glenn is suffering from
    a hamstring strain\nthat he suffered in last week's practice.  He missed Sunday's
    game and\nwitnessed the \"David Patten Show\".  With Patten showcasing his playmaking\nskills,
    look for Glenn's touches to be reduced when he returns from injury.\nPreviously,
    Glenn was considered the only playmaker on the Patriots offense.\nGlenn can post
    dazzling numbers, but his inconsistency has hurt fantasy\nowners in the past and
    this should once again be the case this season.\n\nWR - Darney Scott - Scott's
    role in the Bengals' offense has seemingly been\nreduced in the last few weeks.
    \ After suffering a rib injury that forced\nScott out of Sunday's game, Kitna
    started finding Peter Warrick on a\nconsistent basis.  With Kitna starting to
    build a rapport with the talented\n2nd year wideout from Florida St., Scott now
    appears to be the team's second\noption in the passing game.\n\nWR - Marvin Minnis
    - Minnis has been non existent in the Chiefs offense\nsince week 1.  With Sylvester
    Morris out for the season, Minnis looked ready\nto take over the role and produce
    quality numbers.  With Trent Green\nstruggling at quarterback, Minnis' fantasy
    impact has been minimal at best.\nIf Minnis is a starter on your roster, your
    receiving corps needs some\nserious help.\n\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\n\nWaiver
    Wire\n\n\nQB - Tom Brady - 5 touchdown passes in the last 2 weeks deserves an
    upgrade\nin my book.  More importantly, Brady has yet to throw an interception
    this\nseason.  When Bledsoe returns from injury, the Patriots' coaching staff
    will\nhave a very difficult decision to make.  Right now, Brady deserves a pickup\nby
    any fantasy team needing a quarterback.\n\nRB - Richard Huntley - Huntley has
    been named the team's starter after the\nseason ending foot injury to Tim Biakabatuka.
    \ It was only a matter of time\nbefore Biakabatuka would get injured or benched
    again.  With the Panthers\nfacing the Jets pitiful run defense this week, Huntley
    should pay instant\ndividends.\n\nRB - Doug Chapman - Chapman was able to rush
    for 90 yards on 22 carries in\nreplacement of the injured Michael Bennett.  With
    the unproductive Bennett\nsuffering from an ankle injury, Chapman will be given
    the chance to earn the\nteam's starting running back job.  Grab him, if he is
    available.\n\nRB - Jason Brookins - Terry Allen's ankle sprain may be all Brookins
    needs\nto become the team's starting running back.  He's looked good running behind\na
    quality offensive line, but his carries have been limited due to Allen's\npresence.
    \ Keep in mind, the Ravens are contacting other teams about trading\nfor another
    back prior to the trade deadline.  Right now, Brookins is a\nsolid waiver wire
    choice.\n\nWR - David Patten - Anyone who rushes, passes and receives for a touchdown\nin
    the same game deserves an upgrade.  With Terry Glenn being bothered by a\nhamstring
    injury, Patten made the most of his opportunity.  He has looked\ngood over the
    last few weeks and has shown the ability to make plays, which\nis needed in the
    Patriots offense.  Grab him, if you are in need of a\nreceiver.\n\nWR - David
    Terrell - Terrell had a breakout game on Sunday with 7 catches\nfor 91 yards.
    \ More importantly for his fantasy value, Marcus Robinson\nsuffered a serious
    knee injury and is lost for the season.  The Robinson\ninjury makes way for Terrell
    to enter the Bears' starting lineup.  If you're\nin need of a receiver, Terrell
    is the best option in the free agent market,\nif he is still available.\n\nWR
    - Rod Gardner - While Michael Westbrook appears invisible, Gardner is\nimpressing
    on the other side of the field.  208 yards and a touchdown (with\nanother score
    called back), Gardner is starting to claim the title of \"best\nrookie receiver\".
    \ Grab him, if he is available in your league.  Gardner is\nthe lone bright spot
    in the Redskins passing game.\n\nWR - Larry Foster - With Herman Moore and Germaine
    Crowell out for the\nseason, the Lions will insert Larry Foster into the lineup.
    \ Foster is a\ntalented receiver out of LSU with playmaking skills.  If you are
    in a deep\nleague and in need of receiver help, give Foster a shot on your team.\n\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\n\nBryant

  body: ! "From Enron's Proxy:\n \n    During 2000, certain Enron subsidiaries and
    affiliates (defined for\npurposes of the following paragraphs, \"Enron\") entered
    into a number of\ntransactions with LJM2 Co-Investment, L.P. (\"LJM2\"), a private
    investment\ncompany that primarily engages in acquiring or investing in energy
    and\ncommunications-related investments, primarily involving either assets Enron
    had\ndecided to sell or risk management activities intended to limit Enron's exposure\nto
    price and value fluctuations with respect to various assets. Andrew S.\nFastow,
    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Enron, is the\nmanaging
    member of LJM2's general partner. The general partner of LJM2 is\nentitled to
    receive a percentage of the profits of LJM2 in excess of the general\npartner's
    portion of the total capital contributed to LJM2, depending upon the\nperformance
    of the investments made by LJM2. In ten of these transactions LJM2\nacquired various
    debt and equity securities, or other ownership interests, from\nEnron that were
    directly or indirectly engaged in the domestic and/or\ninternational energy or
    communications business, while in one transaction LJM2\nacquired dark fiber from
    an Enron subsidiary. The aggregate consideration agreed\nto be paid to Enron pursuant
    to these eleven transactions was approximately $213\nmillion. Also during 2000,
    LJM2 sold to Enron certain merchant investment\ninterests for a total consideration
    of approximately $76 million.\n\n     Also, during 2000, Enron engaged in other
    transactions with LJM2 intended\nto manage price and value risk with regard to
    certain merchant and similar\nassets by entering into derivatives, including swaps,
    puts, and collars. As part\nof such risk management transactions, LJM2 purchased
    equity interests in four\nstructured finance vehicles for a total of approximately
    $127 million. Enron, in\nturn, contributed a combination of assets, Enron notes
    payable, restricted\nshares of outstanding Enron stock (and the restricted right
    to receive\nadditional Enron shares) in exchange for interests in the vehicles.
    Enron and\nLJM2 subsequently entered into derivative transactions through these
    four\nvehicles with a combined notional amount of approximately $2.1 billion.
    These\ntransactions occurred in the ordinary course of Enron's business and were\nnegotiated
    on an arm's length basis with senior officers of Enron other than Mr.\nFastow.
    Management believes that the terms of the transactions were reasonable\nand no
    less favorable than the terms of similar arrangements with unrelated\nthird parties.\n\n\n "

  subject: ! '[Footballguys] BREAKING NEWS - Seifert Names Huntley Starting RB'
  body: ! "Hi Folks,\n\nAs we reported to you last night, Tshimanga Biakabutuka is
    out for the year\nwith a broken foot.   That brought an avalanche of \"who's the
    starter now?\"\nemails.\n\nFortunately, Coach George Seifert answered that today
    in his weekly press\nconference.\n\nFrom the Official Panthers Website:\nhttp://www.cpanthers.com/games/index.cfm?cont_id=75023\n\nSeifert
    on Sunday's Injuries:   \"There is significant loss as far as a\ncouple of our
    players. Tshimanga Biakabutuka's right foot was operated on\nlast night. It will
    be some time before he will be able to be active. By\nsome time, I mean a number
    of months. He is obviously going to go on injured\nreserve and won't play this
    season. Also, an ACL tear was sustained by Kevin\nDonnalley in his right knee,
    and he is going to be placed on injured reserve\nas well. It will probably be
    a couple of weeks before he has that operated\non. Hannibal Navies broke his right
    arm, and he is being operated on today.\nHe will be out a minimum of six weeks.
    It could be longer, so there are some\ndecisions that have to be made there, also.
    Those are the three most\nsignificant injuries. I don't have anything to report
    specifically about any\nothers right now. Steve Smith's knee is bothering him.
    But I've got to wait\nuntil Wednesday when I can be more accurate about who is
    going to be\navailable to us. Obviously, Biakabutuka, Donnalley and Navies won't
    be. Dan\nMorgan will not play. Kory Minor will not play. Deveron Harper will not\nplay.
    We will wait and see on Jason Peter.\"\n\nSeifert on running back Richard Huntley:
    \  \"As we go into this next game,\nHuntley would be our starting running back.
    He has progressed from the\nstandpoint that he is now healthy. There was a period
    throughout camp where\nhe didn't practice. So he has a better feel for what we
    are doing. He hasn't\nhad an awful lot of opportunities, but now is the time when
    somebody comes\nto the front. Here's a golden opportunity. He came in here wanting
    to be the\nstarting back. Now he is going to have his chance to do that.\"\n\n\n[
    [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [  OUR VIEW  ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ]\n\n\nAs Seifert
    said, this is Huntley's \"Golden Opportunity\".   Not quite the\n\"Golden Opportunity\"
    handed to Trung Canidate as the Panthers are a\nstruggling team, but still, Huntley
    gives you the chance to scoop up an NFL\nStarting RB and that doesn't happen very
    often.   The injury to OL Kevin\nDonnalley will hurt though.   Carolina gets a
    break this week against the\nJets but they have a tough stretch after that with
    Miami, St. Louis, San\nFrancisco, Atlanta and New Orleans.   So I wouldn't trade
    the farm to pick\nhim up, but he could be a value if the price is right.\n\nMore
    as we hear it.\n\nJoe\n\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\nBryant

  body: ! "\nTitle: Viewing Environmental Strategy Issues in a New Light \t\nURL(s):\t\n\nhttp://www20.cera.com/eprofile?u=35&m=2758;\n\n\n***********************************************************************\n\nSTRATEGIC
    CHALLENGES GROW IN ENVIRONMENTAL ARENA\n\nThe issues that are most prominent in
    the environmental arena are notable for \ntheir relatively long time horizons.
    Thus, although the uncertainty created by \nrecent events might cause adjustments
    in environmental strategies it is less \nlikely to result in fundamental shifts
    in direction. In the immediate future, \nhowever, the challenge will be in responding
    to a shifting landscape while \nmaintaining long-term objectives.\n\n* Parties
    to the Kyoto Protocol are forging ahead with final negotiations, \nwhile the US
    focus is on when a domestic climate change policy might appear.\n\n* The European
    Union is moving toward development of a unified greenhouse gas \nemissions trading
    scheme, while individual European nations are developing or \nimplementing their
    own (potentially incompatible) systems.\n\n* Continued technology maturation combined
    with heightened energy security \nconcerns is solidifying the foundation of the
    renewable energy niche, bringing \nincreased focus on remaining technical and
    political hurdles.\n\n**end**\n\nFollow above URL for complete CERA Watch.\n\n\nE-mail

  subject: ! '[Footballguys] BREAKING NEWS - Edgerrin James Update'
  body: ! "James Questionable for Nov 4 Game\n\n\nEntire story:   http://espn.go.com/nfl/news/2001/1026/1269528.html\n\nClipped
    from the ESPN.com article:\n\nINDIANAPOLIS -- Two-time NFL rushing champ Edgerrin
    James could miss the\nIndianapolis Colts game next week at Buffalo because of
    a sprained left\nknee.\n\nJames injured the knee with about 41/2 minutes remaining
    in Thursday's 35-28\nvictory at Kansas City. James was hurt when his foot stuck
    in the Arrowhead\nStadium grass as linebacker Marvcus Patton tackled him.\n\nColts
    coach Jim Mora said James had an MRI exam Friday that confirmed he had\na sprained
    knee -- but no structural damage.\n\nMora listed James as questionable, meaning
    there's a 50-50 chance he would\nplay Nov. 4 against the Bills.\n\n\"The MRI showed
    that it was sprained, which was basically the prognosis last\nnight,\" Mora said.
    \"I haven't talked to him today, but (trainer) Hunter\n(Smith) has, and he said
    Edgerrin felt pretty good.\"\n\nJames and other Colts players were not available
    Friday because Mora gave\nthem three days off.\n\nJames won rushing titles in
    each of his first two NFL seasons and, through\nsix games this season, is in contention
    for a third straight crown.\n\nOn Thursday, James carried 27 times for 102 yards.
    It was his fifth 100-yard\ngame this season and the 24th of his career, which
    tied the team record set\nby Eric Dickerson.\n\nEarlier this season, James tied
    Jim Brown as the second-fastest running back\nto 3,500 yards rushing, which he
    achieved in 34 games. James has 3,924 yards\nrushing in his career.\n\nThe knee
    injury, however, has put James' streak of 38 consecutive starts in\njeopardy.
    Indianapolis doesn't practice again until Monday, and Mora said he\n\"doubted\"
    James would practice then.\n\n\"We've still got nine days before we play again,\"
    Mora said. \"So we're going\nto take it day by day.\"\n\nIf James cannot go, the
    Colts appear to have found a more than adequate\nreplacement in backup Dominic
    Rhodes.\n\nUntil Thursday, Rhodes, a rookie free agent from Midwestern Texas State,
    had\ncarried six times for 56 yards.\n\nIn James' absence Friday, Rhodes burst
    onto the scene by returning a kickoff\n88 yards for one touchdown, then racing
    77 yards for another touchdown on\nhis fourth carry.\n\nRhodes' run was the fourth-longest
    in franchise history and the longest by a\nColt since Tom Matte raced 80 yards
    against the St. Louis Cardinals on Oct.\n12, 1964.\n\n\"I was just glad to get
    the opportunity,\" Rhodes said after the game. \"I\nwish it wasn't because Edgerrin
    got hurt. (Running backs) Coach (Gene) Huey\nhas been telling me to just hang
    in there and my time would come. I guess he\nwas right tonight.\"\n\nRhodes outran
    Chiefs defenders to the end zone on both touchdown runs and\nplayed well enough
    to put Mora's mind at ease -- if James cannot play a week\nfrom Sunday.\n\n\"I
    feel very good about Dominic Rhodes,\" Mora said. \"He's done nothing but\nshow
    us he can be a good back in this league. He hits it hard and he has\ngood hands.\"\n\nThat's
    one reason Rhodes might continue returning kickoffs even if he\nreplaces James
    against the Bills.\n\nMora said he would wait to see if Terrence Wilkins could
    return. The wide\nreceiver-returner has missed the last two games with broken
    ribs. If neither\nWilkins nor James plays, Rhodes is likely to see double duty.\n\nBut
    Mora remains optimistic that James will heal during the nine-day break\nbetween
    games.\n\n\"We'll take it day by day,\" Mora said. \"We'll put him down as questionable\nright
    now, but we're hoping he can play.\"\n\n\n[ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [  OUR VIEW
    \ ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ]\n\n\nClearly, not great news but also better
    than it might have been.   Dominic\nRhodes could be a great insurance pickup if
    he's still available.   This\nwill certainly be a hot topic and something we'll
    stay on top of for you.\n\nJoe\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\n\nBryant

    You'll get the chance \nto be heard by thousands of Fantasy players just like
    \nyourself! \n\nChris Trautman, LaCrosse, WI: I am stuck on my last starter. \nShould
    I go with Shaun Alexander or 3 WRs and start Marty \nBooker? Alexander ripped
    it up at home two weeks ago and he \nis at home again versus a good Miami team,
    but Booker should \nbe featured more since Marcus Robinson went down for the \nseason.\n\nG.G.:
    Alexander has been a revelation in his first two \nstarts, but now he faces a
    team that may not back down to \nhim. The Dolphins have a superb run defense that
    should not \nbe judged by its recent failures against Marshall Faulk and \nCurtis
    Martin. Miami will be fired up to face Alexander, who \nmay have his first forgettable
    game as a starter. Booker \nwill face an underrated San Francisco secondary, and
    is not \ndestined to have a big day. Neither player seems like a \ngreat start,
    but we recommend Alexander because he may score \na late TD if the Seahawks have
    to play catch-up against a \nMiami team that gives them all kinds of matchup problems.\n\nMark
    MacKay, San Diego, CA: Should I start Rod Gardner or \nIke Hilliard this week?
    Rod had a good Week Six, but Ike is \nlooking better each week.\n\nG.G.: Gardner's
    huge day means two things. One, he gains \ninstant Fantasy notice. Two, his next
    opponent will be \ngeared to shut him down after extensive film study. The \nGiants
    have been very solid defensively, and will be one of \nthe better units the rookie
    has seen so far. Hilliard is \nquickly recapturing his old form, and might be
    the Giants' \nNo. 1 receiver if Amani Toomer is benched. He'll be facing \nChamp
    Bailey though, so Hilliard is not due for a big week. \nNeither player looks like
    a great start, but we'll go with \nHilliard because of his experience and continuing
    \nimprovement.\n\nJohn Kersey, Denver, CO: I have already decided to start \nLaDainian
    Tomlinson. Who should I start as my No. 2 RB - \nJason Brookins, Anthony Thomas
    or Mike Anderson?\n\nG.G: Brookins is the best back on the Baltimore roster, but
    \nthe Ravens are still not showing a lot of confidence in \nhim, so he is a risky
    start. It is difficult to sit Thomas \nafter the breakout game he had last week,
    but he will face a \nrespectable run defense. Anderson will start against a \nPatriots
    team that has been surprisingly effective against \nthe run at times. In such
    a case, we recommend sticking with \nthe hotter player, and that would be Thomas.\n\n\nMVP.com\n\nNFL

    OF THE WEEK:\n\nWalter Mathis, Pompano Beach, FL: Remember that football is \na
    game that is fueled by emotion. Sometimes, emotions \noverride matchups. Curtis
    Martin will always rip holes in \nthe Miami defense. Lamar Smith will be fired
    up to face the \nSeahawks this week, because he began his career in Seattle. \nAnd
    in divisional games, big players do well. Don't be \nsurprised if Eddie George
    comes up big against Pittsburgh.\n\n\nSPORTING NEWS\n\nSubscribe to The Sporting

    The <b>Dolphins</b> have a superb run defense that should not \nbe judged by its
    recent failures against <b>Marshall Faulk</b> and <b> \nCurtis Martin</b>. Miami
    will be fired up to face Alexander, who \nmay have his first forgettable game
    as a starter. Booker \nwill face an underrated San Francisco secondary, and is
    not \ndestined to have a big day. Neither player seems like a \ngreat start, but

  subject: UPDATE - Supported Internet Email Addresses
  body: ! "\nEarlier this week, Enron Global Technology announced the plan to decommission
    the use of all non-standard Internet Email address formats. As mentioned in the
    previous communication, this was the first of several communications to be sent
    by the Enron Global Technology group and we will continue to provide more details
    in the coming weeks regarding this significant but necessary change to our Email
    environment.\n \nWe are working toward a cut-off date of January 14, 2002, at
    which time we will no longer support Email addresses that do not follow the standard
    format of firstname.lastname@enron.com (or firstname.middleinitial.lastname@enron.com
    if your name in Lotus Notes or Outlook has a middle initial in it). We understand
    that it will take time to make the necessary arrangements to begin using the standard
    Email address format, but it is important to begin making the change now.\n \nIf
    you have questions, please send an Email to Enron.Messaging.Administration@enron.com.\n
    \nThank you for your support.\n \nEnron Global Technology\n \n \n \n-----Original
    Message----- \nFrom: Enron Announcements/Corp/Enron@ENRON on behalf of Enron Messaging
    Administration \nSent: Mon 10/15/2001 9:15 PM \nTo: All Enron Worldwide@ENRON
    \nCc: \nSubject: Supported Internet Email Addresses\n\n\n\nEnron Global Technology
    is in the process of decommissioning the support for all non-standard Internet
    Email address formats. The only Internet Email address format that will be supported,
    once this effort is completed, is firstname.lastname@enron.com. We will no longer
    support Internet Email address formats such as name@enron.com, name@ect.enron.com,
    name@ei.enron.com  (where \"name\" is an abbreviation, acronym or alternative
    to an employees firstname and/or lastname). Every Enron employee has an Internet
    Email address of firstname.lastname@enron.com and must begin making the necessary
    arrangements to start using this Internet address format if they are not using
    it already.\n\nAny new/existing application systems or business cards that reference
    a non-supported Internet Email address will need to be changed to reference the
    only supported firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet address format. It is important
    to remember to also notify any external contacts who are currently sending Internet
    email to any non-supported Internet Email addresses.\n\nTo determine what your
    supported Internet Email address is, take your name as it appears in Outlook or
    Lotus Notes and replace any \"spaces\" that appear in your name with periods and
    append @enron.com. For example in Outlook, Alan Smith, Robert (firstname = Robert,
    Lastname = Alan Smith) will have a supported Internet Email address of robert.alan.smith@enron.com.\n\nIMPORTANT
    : If you need to update your business card(s) to reflect your supported Internet
    Email address, please ensure you test & confirm the delivery of Internet email
    to your supported email address prior to updating your business cards. If you
    experience any issues with delivery of Internet email to your supported Internet
    email address, please contact the Resolution Center.\n\nWe will communicate further
    details, including the cut-off date, in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, it is imperative
    that you begin making the necessary arrangements to change over to using the firstname.lastname@enron.com
    Internet Email address format. If you have questions regarding this email, send
    an Email to enron.messaging.administration@enron.com.\n\nThank you for participation,
    cooperation and support. \n\nEnron Messaging Administration"

    go-to guy right now. That makes both risky starts.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=\"http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=69677&random=3664&key=1149&\"><B>Charlie

    FACE=\"Arial, Helvetica\"><FONT SIZE=2>\nMcNabb passed for just 133 yards and
    no touchdowns Sunday against Oakland, but he didn't get intercepted either. It
    was asking a lot for him to post great stats against the Raiders' defense, but
    this was still a disappointment. McNabb is in a bit of a slump right now, but
    he should break out of it and be a useful Fantasy quarterback over the second
    half of the season.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=\"http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=69677&random=3664&key=12623&\"><B>Michael

    great for the Fantasy owner, and they came against a weak Cardinals' secondary.

  subject: ! '[Footballguys] Update #184 - Players in the News'
  body: ! "Congratulations!   If you're still reading this late in the season, \nyou're
    likely in your playoffs (and well on your way to winning your \nleague...)   We've
    said all along that it's you guys who make the \nsite what it is.  We want to
    show our appreciation and give you guys \nsome due props.   \n \nBeginning Monday,
    we'll be accepting teams for display on our \nFootballguys Wall of Champions.
    \  In this wacky season, making the \nplayoffs is a feat in itself and we'll be
    displaying teams that make \ntheir playoffs as well as league winners.\n \nHere's
    a chance to boast a little and rub it in the faces of your \nleaguemates who're
    on the sidelines watching as you battle for the \nleague championship.\n \nSee
    the site for details.\n \nJoe and David\n\n*******************************************\n\nand
    now onto the news:\n\n\n\nQuarterbacks in the News:\n\nRob Johnson (Buf) is out.
    \ \n\nScott Mitchell (Cin) injured himself in Wednesday's practice and\nis now
    doubtful for this weekend.\n\nCincinnati has signed Scott Covington.  He will
    backup Jon Kitna this \nweek.\n\nGus Frerotte (Den) has been placed on I/R and
    is out for the rest of \nthe season.  In related news, the team signed Todd Husak
    for the \nremainder of the season.\n\nMark Brunell (Jac) is expected to practice
    on Thursday.  He appears \non the injury report as probable with a sore quadriceps.
    \n\nDaunte Culpepper (Min) underwent surgery and is likely lost for the \nseason.
    \ Todd Bouman will start in his place.  He is nursing a \nsprained ligament in
    the thumb of his throwing hand, but is expected \nto play on Sunday. \n\nJeff
    Garcia (SF) was held out of practice on Wednesday and may be \nrested this week.
    \ He appears on the injury report as questionable \nwith sore ribs.  Jeff would
    like to play, but coach Steve Mariucci is \nconsidering resting Jeff so that he
    is closer to 100% for the \nplayoffs.  This would seem to make sense since the
    Rams have likely \nlocked up winning the Division.  The 49ers believe they will
    need a \nhealthy, scrambling Jeff Garcia to go deep into the post season.  If
    \nJeff does not play, look for Tim Rattay to get the start.    \n\nSteve McNair
    (Ten), despite being listed on the injury report as \nquestionable with a sore
    back is expected to start.  \n\n*******************************************\n\nRunning

    Henry is listed as \nout with a bad knee.  Sammy Morris will spell Shawn.\n\nJames
    Jackson (Cle) is out this week and is likely going to miss the \nremainder of
    the season with his bad ankle.  Jamel White and Ben Gay \nwill both see duty in
    this week's game.\n\nJames Stewart (Det) practiced on Wednesday and likely will
    start on \nSunday.\n\nAhman Green (GB) did not complete the full practice on Wednesday,
    but \nhe is expected to play on Sunday.\n\nFred Taylor (Jac) continues to show
    up on the injury report as \nquestionable with a sore groin, but do not look for
    him to play any \ntime soon.  The injury is significantly worse than the team
    has let \non.\n\nElvis Joseph (Jac) has a sore shoulder, but is expected to backup
    \nStacey Mack.\n\nPriest Holmes (KC) was excused from practice today.  He is expected
    \nto practice the rest of the week and will start on Sunday.  He \nappears on
    the injury report as probable with a pulled groin.\n\nRob Konrad (Mia) has a stiff
    neck, but is expected to play on \nSaturday against the Patriots.\n\nJim Kleinsasser

    to start despite a hairline crack to \none of his ribs.  He appears on the injury
    report as questionable.  \n\nJon Ritchie (Oak) is expected to play if needed.
    \ He appears on the \ninjury report as probable with a sore ankle.\n\nJerome Bettis
    (Pit) missed practice Wednesday.  He is listed as \ndoubtful on the injury report
    with a pulled groin.\n\nAmos Zereoue (Pit) missed practice Wednesday.  He is expected
    to \ncontribute on Sunday as a backup to Chris Fuamatu Ma'afala\ndespite being
    listed as questionable with a sore shoulder.\n\nTerrell Fletcher (SD) is out with
    a bad hamstring.  LaDainian \nTomlinson will carry the running game like most
    weeks.\n\nWarrick Dunn (TB) will play with turf toe.  He appears on the injury
    \nreport as probable.\n\nSkip Hicks (Ten) is expected to get significant playing
    time this \nweek.  Eddie George will continue to start.\n\nStephen Davis (Was)
    did not practice on Wednesday.  He still is \nexpected to start, but may be a
    gametime decision.  He appears on the \ninjury report as questionable with a sore
    knee.  Proceed with caution.\n\n*******************************************\n\nWide
    Receivers in the News:\n\nMartay Jenkins (Ari) missed Wednesday's practice with

    as probable.\n\nPeerless Price (Buf) was unable to practice Wednesday on his sore
    \nankle.  He is listed as questionable on the injury report with a \nsprained
    ankle.  If he is unable to go, Reggie Germany would get the \nstart opposite of

    be a gametime decision.  He appears on the injury report as \nquestionable with
    a sore toe.\n\nBert Emanuel (Det) completed the Wednesday practice and is expected
    \nto play on Sunday.  He appears on the injury report as probable with \na sore

    appears on the injury report as questionable with \na sore thigh.  He was held
    out of practice on Wednesday.\n\nTerrence Wilkins (Ind) is doubtful with a hamstring
    injury.  Marvin \nHarrison and Marcus Pollard are likely to get the majority of
    the \npass attempts again this week.\n\nOronde Gadsden (Mia) continues to miss
    practice and is very \nquestionable to play Saturday.  He appears on the injury
    report as \nquestionable with a sore hamstring.  Rookie Chris Chambers is \nexpected
    to start in his place. \n\nJames McKnight (Mia) has a sore back, but is expected
    to start \nopposite of Chris Chambers.  He is listed as probable on the injury
    \nreport.\n\nCris Carter (Min) hinted to reporters that this is likely his final
    \nseason in the NFL.  Of course he said all those things last year, but \nno one
    is now believing this team is very close to winning a \nSuperbowl soon.   \n\nTerry
    Glenn (NE) is expected to see increased playing time on \nSaturday.\n\nSantana
    Moss (NYJ) was able to practice Wednesday, but is not likely \nto make a big impact

    in Houston, Texas.   This event will be particularly timely and\nimportant in
    light of the recent major events transforming the global\nenergy landscape.  I
    wanted to extend my personal recommendation that\nyou join us in Houston to exchange
    ideas, interact with peer level\nsenior decision makers, and gain new insight

    and perspectives on the\nmajor new risks and challenges facing energy decision-makers,
    including\nthe implications of the profound changes that the world has witnessed\nover
    the past months.  Among the key topics and questions are:\n\n* The new geopolitics
    -- what are the implications for energy security,\nglobal investment, sanctions,
    and stability?\n\n* Markets in turmoil -- what are the prospects for oil, natural
    gas and\nelectric power prices and asset valuation?\n\n* Deregulation -- what
    will be the responses to the new threats to\nworkable competitive markets? \n\n*
    Industry structure and competitive dynamics -- How are companies\npositioning
    and aligning themselves for the new world?\n\nOur focus is on all key regions
    and energy sectors--oil, natural gas and\npower.  We have introduced four focused

  subject: ! '[Footballguys] Update # 181 Week 15 Passing Matchups'
  body: ! "Hi Folks,\n\nHere's how I see the Passing Game Matchups this week.\n\nPLEASE
    NOTE:   See the cheatsheets online at www.footballguys.com  for\nexactly where
    I rank players and to determine who to start.   I always\nreceive emails asking
    me how I can have a guy ranked highly on the\ncheatsheet but listed under a matchup
    that favors the Defense.   Just\nbecause one matchup may be more favorable than
    another, that doesn't\nnecessarily mean I'd start the player with the best matchup.
    \  Peyton\nManning may have a horrible matchup one week but unless you're sitting
    on\nKurt Warner or Daunte Culpepper, Manning's your guy no matter who he's\nlining
    up against.   The matchup info is meant to be just one more tool in\nyour box
    when it comes to deciding between players.\n\nNote:  I've used the player stats
    sorted by performance over the last four\nweeks extensively in developing these
    write-ups. Stats are provided by Mike\nHall's excellent FLM League Management
    Software.  http://www.fflm.com/ for\nmore info.   The points scored by position
    data is from ESPN.com.\nLet's get to it.\n\nJoe\n\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\n\nPassing
    Game Matchups to Avoid and Exploit\n\n\nLocks:  These games feature Defenses that
    should be overmatched against the\nOffense.\n\n\nBuffalo Passing Game vs Atlanta
    Defense\n\nAlex Van Pelt threw for 219 yards and 0 TDs with 1 Interception last
    week.\nHe threw a ton of balls toward Eric Moulds although not many were caught.\nPeerless
    Price is also still a prime target.   TE Jay Reimersma and RB Larry\nCenters will
    see plenty of short throws.   The Falcons rank # 30 in Passing\nYards Allowed
    Per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank #\n30 in Fantasy
    Points Allowed to QBs and # 30 in Fantasy Points Allowed to\nWRs so they've pretty
    much been weak all year defending the pass.\n\n\nDallas Passing Game vs Arizona
    Defense\n\nIt'll be hard to imagine Quincy Carter leading many FF teams to Playoff\nvictories
    this week.   If you've got to go with one, Joey Galloway suddenly\nbecome Carter's
    favorite target last week.  Go figure.   Just when you\nthought he was locking
    on Rocket Ismail.   Both guys are risks.   Even with\nArizona ranked # 27 in Passing
    Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four\nweeks.   For the year, they rank #
    27 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and #\n27 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.
    \  Great matchup, but I just don't have\na lot of faith in these guys being able
    to take advantage of it.\n\n\nOakland Passing Game vs Tennessee Defense\n\nYes,
    Brett Favre and the Packers didn't do much against the Titans last\nweek.   But
    in my opinion, you just can't bench Rich Gannon, Jerry Rice or\nTim Brown.   They're
    just too good and are too liable to explode at any\ntime.   The Titans rank #
    29 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last\nfour weeks so clearly, people
    are throwing on them.   For the year, they\nrank # 29 in Fantasy Points Allowed
    to QBs and # 31 in Fantasy Points\nAllowed to WRs.   Start your Raiders.\n\n\nPittsburgh
    Passing Game vs Detroit Defense\n\nHard to imagine but Kordell Stewart is carrying
    Fantasy Teams right now.\nHe's been awesome and isn't showing any signs that I
    can see of letting up.\nThe one factor he'd been missing, he now seems to have
    in abundance -\nConfidence.   Hines Ward wasn't a big factor receiving but he's
    a great bet.\nPlaxico Burress made the circus catch and looks to be quickly rising
    in the\ncharts.   The Lions are fired up but still rank # 20 in Passing Yards\nAllowed
    Per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 31 in\nFantasy
    Points Allowed to QBs and # 28 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.\n\n\nSt. Louis
    Passing Game vs Carolina Defense\n\nStart your Rams.   Warner, Bruce and Holt
    are sure starters.   Yes, it's\ntough to guess which Ram WR will do well as Warner
    spreads the ball around.\nBut I don't see how you can have either of these guys
    benched as you could\nleave a ton of points on the table.   Carolina ranks # 23
    in Passing Yards\nAllowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they
    rank # 28 in\nFantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 22 in Fantasy Points Allowed
    to WRs.\n\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\n\nPrime Matchups:
    \ These games feature Defenses that should have trouble\nstopping the Offense.\n\n\nCleveland
    Passing Game vs Green Bay Defense\n\nTim Couch evidently had been catching a lot
    of flak from Browns fans for not\nbeing a very accurate passer last week.   Seeing
    as how not one of the\n20,000 bottles thrown on the field actually hit a player
    or ref, I'd guess\nthe fans might want to keep their day jobs...   Couch wasn't
    very effective\nlast week with 184 yards, 0 TDs and 1 Interception.   Normally
    reliable WR\nKevin Johnson came up small as well.   I still have faith in Johnson
    as he's\nshown too much this year to discount him over one game.   The Packers
    rank #\n22 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   For the\nyear,
    they rank # 12 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 5 in Fantasy\nPoints Allowed
    to WRs.\n\n\nKansas City Passing Game vs San Diego Defense\n\nTrent Green's finally
    coming around.   Either that, or he's just teasing\nus...   With the dominant
    running of Priest Holmes, Green is finding room to\nthrow.   Marvin Minnis and
    Derrick Alexander are doing well.   Tony Gonzalez\nisn't as involved as his owners
    would like but he's a sure starter in TE\nleagues.   The Chargers rank # 18 in
    Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the\nlast four weeks.   For the year, they
    rank # 21 in Fantasy Points Allowed to\nQBs and # 15 in Fantasy Points Allowed
    to WRs.\n\n\nMinnesota Passing Game vs Jacksonville Defense\n\nThe hits just keep
    rolling for Minnesota.   QB Todd Bouman's thumb is\ncausing serious worry.   Enough
    that there's talk that Spergon Wynn could\nget the start.   Stay tuned on this
    one.   Randy Moss has clearly decided to\nplay lately and will wind up with season
    long stats that'll make all the non\nMoss owners wonder what all the Moss guys
    were complaining about early on.\nCris Carter is definitely taking a backseat
    to Moss lately.   The Jaguars\nrank # 26 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over
    the last four weeks.   For\nthe year, they rank # 18 in Fantasy Points Allowed
    to QBs and # 8 in Fantasy\nPoints Allowed to WRs.\n\n\nNew York Jets Passing Game
    vs Indianapolis Defense\n\nThe Jets are tough to call lately.   Testeverde threw
    for 196 yards and did\nmanage 2 TDs.   But Laveranues Coles didn't do a lot.   (Although
    Chris\nBerman's call of \"Laveranues Coles 'shopping' for 18 yards\" was classic
    on\nthe Prime Time highlights...)   Wayne Chrebet was more active and of course\nAnthony
    Becht caught the TD but not much else.   All in all, a risky place\nfor FF passing
    game material.   Curtis Martin should run wild on this bunch.\nThe Colts rank
    # 21 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four\nweeks.   For the year,
    they rank # 26 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and #\n26 in Fantasy Points Allowed
    to WRs.\n\n\nPhiladelphia Passing Game vs San Francisco Defense\n\nThe passing
    game lately has been Donovan McNabb throwing to Duce Staley.\nThat's ok as long
    as they get the yards.   Todd Pinkston and James Thrash\nhave been inconsistent.
    \  They'll face a 49er team that's been pretty soft\nlately ranking # 24 in Passing
    Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four\nweeks.   For the year, they rank #
    15 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and #\n19 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.\n\n\nTennessee
    Passing Game vs Oakland Defense\n\nI never thought I'd be writing about the pass
    happy Titans but that's the\ncase.   Steve McNair has been awesome lately and
    ranks as the # 2 QB in the\nleague over the last 3 games.   Derrick Mason and
    Kevin Dyson are starters\nin just about every league.   TE Frank Wycheck is producing
    like always.\nThe Raiders rank # 19 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the
    last four\nweeks.   For the year, they rank # 11 in Fantasy Points Allowed to
    QBs and #\n12 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.\n\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\n\nEven
    Matchups:  These games feature no real advantage either way\n\n\nAtlanta Passing
    Game vs Buffalo Defense\n\nIt's tough to depend on Chris Chandler but last week
    he played very well\nthrowing for 249 yards and 2 TDs.   Tony Martin seems to
    be coming on a bit.\nWe said we loved Brian Finneran and he scored.   He's not
    on the field\nenough (yet) to be a solid starter but he makes things happen out
    there.\nRB Bob Christian is an integral part of the passing game as well.   This\nweek,
    they'll face a Buffalo defense ranked # 13 in Passing Yards Allowed\nPer Game
    over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 24 in Fantasy\nPoints Allowed
    to QBs and # 17 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.\n\n\nBaltimore Passing Game
    vs Cincinnati Defense\n\nElvis Grbac managed 2 TDs with just 159 yards Sunday
    night.   Picking a\nreceiver for the Ravens is as tough as ever with Ismail /
    Stokely / Taylor\nall in the mix.   TE Shannon Sharpe is the sure bet.   This
    week, they'll\nface the Bengals ranked # 10 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game
    over the last\nfour weeks.   For the year, they rank # 19 in Fantasy Points Allowed
    to QBs\nand # 23 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.   Terry Allen should be more
    of a\nfactor in this one as well.\n\n\nGreen Bay Passing Game vs Cleveland Defense\n\nI
    can't imagine benching Brett Favre right now.   He seems to get better as\nit
    gets colder and they have a lot riding on these next few games after\nlosing to
    Tennessee Sunday.   Antonio Freeman and Billy Schroeder both\nshould be ready
    to play.   The Browns have been tough lately ranking # 8 in\nPassing Yards Allowed
    Per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year,\nthey rank # 3 in Fantasy Points
    Allowed to QBs and # 18 in Fantasy Points\nAllowed to WRs.\n\n\nJacksonville Passing
    Game vs Minnesota Defense\n\nMark Brunell posted 202 yards , 1 TD and 2 Interceptions
    Sunday.   Keenan\nMcCardell and Jimmy Smith were as active as usual.   They're
    two of the\nsteadiest guys in the league.   It's surprising, but Minnesota's been
    tough\nlately against the pass ranking # 7 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over\nthe
    last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 22 in Fantasy Points\nAllowed to
    QBs and # 21 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.\n\n\nMiami Passing Game vs New
    England Defense\n\nThe problem with Jay Fiedler is that when he's ugly, he's really
    ugly.   If\nyou started him Sunday, you know what I mean.   149 yards, 0 TDs and
    3\nInterceptions wont win Real or Fantasy Games for anyone.   Oronde Gadsden\nwas
    injured to boot.   Gasden said he'll be ready Sunday.   Chris Chambers\nstill
    has tons of upside if you're ready to roll the dice.   New England\nranks # 25
    in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   For\nthe year, they
    rank # 16 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 13 in\nFantasy Points Allowed
    to WRs.\n\n\nSan Diego Passing Game vs Kansas City Defense\n\nDoug Flutie threw
    3 Interceptions Sunday with 0 TDs.   Another day like that\nand he'll see Drew
    Brees finishing the game.   You might see Brees anyway as\nthey'll want to start
    taking a look at their QB of the future.   Jeff Graham\nand Curtis Conway continue
    to play well.  Tim Dwight could miss another game\ndue to his lung problem.   TE
    Freddie Jones is inconsistent but if you own\nhim, he's probably a starter for
    you.   Kansas City ranks # 16 in Passing\nYards Allowed Per Game over the last
    four weeks.   For the year, they rank #\n14 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and
    # 11 in Fantasy Points Allowed to\nWRs.\n\n\nSeattle Passing Game vs New York
    Giants Defense\n\nWith 152 yards, 0 Interceptions and 0 TDs, you can say at least
    Hasselbeck\ndidn't do anything to hurt the Seahawks.   Darrell Jackson is the
    clear # 1\nguy although Koren Robinson will see his share of passes.   The Giants
    rank\n# 14 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   For the\nyear,
    they rank # 17 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 29 in Fantasy\nPoints Allowed
    to WRs.\n\n\nTampa Bay Passing Game vs New Orleans Defense\n\nJohnson threw an
    ugly game last week with 191 yards, 0 TDs and 2\nInterceptions.   If a team finds
    a way to limit Keyshawn Johnson, the\npassing game is gone.   Granted, most teams
    have trouble keeping Keyshawn\nfrom getting his catches, but the over reliance
    on one receiver severely\nrestricts the offense in my opinion.   Warrick Dunn
    saw plenty of passes\nSunday but it wasn't enough.   At this point, Keyshawn is
    the only\nconsistent starter in this passing game.   New Orleans ranks # 17 in
    Passing\nYards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks after the St. Louis game\nMonday
    night.   For the year, they rank # 25 in Fantasy Points Allowed to\nQBs and #
    24 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.\n\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\n\nDownside
    Matchups:  These games feature a Defense that could pose trouble\nfor the Offense.\n\n\nCarolina
    Passing Game vs St. Louis Defense\n\nSurely, you're not down to Chris Weinke are
    you?   Even with a week to rest,\nI'm not excited about their prospects.   Muhsin
    Muhammad might be an option\nfor some teams.   TE Wesley Walls just doesn't seem
    to consistently get on\nthe same page as Weinke.   The Rams rank # 9 in Passing
    Yards Allowed Per\nGame over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank #
    13 in Fantasy\nPoints Allowed to QBs and # 7 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.\n\n\nCincinnati
    Passing Game vs Baltimore Defense\n\nDon't even go there.   Maybe Peter Warrick
    in a stretch if you're desperate\nbut that's pretty much it.   This team is all
    about Corey Dillon.\nUnfortunately, the Ravens picked up on that as well.   They
    rank # 31 in\nPassing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks with 811
    passing\nyards allowed in 3 games.   For the year, they rank # 20 in Fantasy Points\nAllowed
    to QBs and # 20 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.   Even so, I'd\nstill avoid.\n\n\nDetroit
    Passing Game vs Pittsburgh Defense\n\nMike McMahon led the Lions to the feel good
    story of the week Sunday as they\nbeat the Vikings.   Hats off to them and their
    fans.   They kept playing\nhard.   Mike McMahon looked very good and definitely
    showed some flashes of\ntalent with his scrambling ability.   He threw for 241
    yards with 0 TDs but\nalso 0 Interceptions.   Johnnie Morton is the clear cut
    # 1 Guy but Scottie\nAnderson did well too.   The Steelers rank # 28 in Passing
    Yards Allowed Per\nGame over the last four weeks primarily because nobody can
    run on them.\nFor the year, they rank # 4 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and
    # 10 in\nFantasy Points Allowed to WRs.\n\n\nNew Orleans Passing Game vs Tampa
    Bay Defense\n\nStart Aaron Brooks.   Like you need me to tell you that.   Joe
    Horn and\nprobably Willie Jackson are starters in your league as well.   Looks
    like\nCam Cleeland has taken over all of the work Boo Williams was seeing at TE.\nThese
    guys are hot.   Ricky Williams reportedly has a hairline fracture in\none of his
    ribs but is expected to play.   You have to think this will at\nleast throw a
    little more focus on the passing game though.   The Bucs rank\n# 5 in Passing
    Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks so they're\ntough.   For the year,
    they rank # 7 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and #\n6 in Fantasy Points Allowed
    to WRs.\n\n\nNew York Giants Passing Game vs Seattle Defense\n\nCollins has been
    up and down.   He did have 2 TDs last week but only threw\nfor 147 yards.   Amani
    Toomer was the clear # 1 Guy with Ike Hilliard\napparently hurting.   Ron Dixon
    got into the action with a TD but he's\ninconsistent.   The Seahawks rank a very
    solid # 3 in Passing Yards Allowed\nPer Game over the last four weeks.   For the
    year, they rank # 23 in Fantasy\nPoints Allowed to QBs and # 9 in Fantasy Points
    Allowed to WRs.\n\n\nSan Francisco Passing Game vs Philadelphia Defense\n\nThe
    49ers showed Sunday they can win in different ways as they rode the legs\nof Garrison
    Hearst and the RB corps to victory.   Jeff Garcia did very\nlittle throwing for
    133 yards and a TD.   He'll likely be needed more this\nweek.   Terrell Owens
    is still his clear cut go to guy.   Garcia could make\nthe Eagles pay with their
    blitz happy defense.   Philadelphia ranks # 12 in\nPassing Yards Allowed Per Game
    over the last four weeks.   For the year,\nthey rank # 2 in Fantasy Points Allowed
    to QBs and # 2 in Fantasy Points\nAllowed to WRs.\n\n\nWashington Passing Game
    vs Chicago Defense\n\nTony Banks struggled last week throwing for 213 yards, 0
    TDs and 2\nInterceptions.   His WR corps of Westbrook and Gardner have been ok
    but not\ngreat lately.   TE Zeron Flemister did see several passes thrown his
    way\nagain.   He's worth a shot if you're in need of a TE.   The Bears have\nimproved
    lately against the pass ranking # 11 in Passing Yards Allowed Per\nGame over the
    last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 10 in Fantasy\nPoints Allowed to
    QBs and # 1 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.\n\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\n\nDefensive
    Slam Dunks:  These games feature a very tough Defense posing major\nproblems for
    the Offense.\n\n\nArizona Passing Game vs Dallas Defense\n\nJake Plummer played
    decent last week with 207 yards and 1 TD.   David Boston\nis a must start at WR.
    \  For you guys desperate for a TE, look at Twayn\nMitchell who had 7 catches
    for 62 yards a TD.   You could do a lot worse.\nWe'll see if he can keep that
    up.   The Cowboys rank # 1 in Passing Yards\nAllowed Per Game over the last four
    weeks.   For the year, they rank # 5 in\nFantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 4
    in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs so\nthis will be no cakewalk.\n\n\nChicago Passing
    Game vs Washington Defense\n\nJim Miller isn't carrying anyone's FF Team lately.
    \  Although his 190 yards\nand 2 TDs Sunday weren't bad.   Marty Booker is still
    seeing a ton of balls\nthrown his way.   And Dez White is seeing action.   David
    Terrell makes the\nmost of what he gets but he's not seeing a lot of passes.   This
    team is\nabout Anthony Thomas and smashmouth football.   They'll have occasional\noutbursts
    of big plays but primarily, it's Thomas.   The Redskins have been\nvery good lately
    ranking # 2 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last\nfour weeks.   For
    the year, they rank # 9 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs\nand # 14 in Fantasy
    Points Allowed to WRs.\n\n\nIndianapolis Passing Game vs New York Jets Defense\n\nWe
    got the predicted bounceback from Manning as he threw for 325 yards and 3\nTDs
    with 1 Interception.   He's been up and down so let's see if he can keep\nit up.
    \  Of course Marvin Harrison is the prime target but rookie Reggie\nWayne's seeing
    lots of passes too.   TE Marcus Pollard was very involved in\nthe game plan last
    week as well.   The Jets rank # 4 in Passing Yards\nAllowed Per Game over the
    last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 1 in\nFantasy Points Allowed to QBs
    and # 3 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.\nTough matchup.\n\n\nNew England Passing
    Game vs Miami Defense\n\nTom Brady continues his slide back to Earth.   He threw
    for 237 yards, 0 TDs\nand 1 Interception last week.   But the Patriots won and
    that's all they\ncare about.   Troy Brown is being hurt by Terry Glenn's return.
    \  Brown,\nGlenn and David Patten all seem to be seeing fairly equal number of\nopportunities.
    \  The Dolphins are tough against the pass ranking # 6 in\nPassing Yards Allowed
    Per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year,\nthey rank # 6 in Fantasy Points
    Allowed to QBs and # 16 in Fantasy Points\nAllowed to WRs.\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\nBryant

    brought to you by the World Championship of Fantasy\nFootball   http://www.wcoff.com\n\nHere's
    the scoop:\n\nTake 504 Hardcore Fantasy Football Junkies, and payout $350,000
    in prizes\nwith $200,000 going home with the winner. Live draft in Las Vegas at

    check out http://www.wcoff.com. Because you're a Footballguys.com\nsubscriber,
    I wanted to give you an early headsup for this exciting\nopportunity.\n\nI talked

    300 applications for the 504 slots. So don't wait too long.\nHopefully, I'll see
    you in Las Vegas.\nJoe\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\nHi
    Folks,\n\nDoing our best to get these to you early in the week as you juggle your\nlineups
    for the stretch run.   Here's how I see the Rushing Game Matchups\nthis week.\n\nPLEASE
    NOTE:   See the cheatsheet online www.footballguys.com for exactly\nwhere I rank
    players and to determine who to start.   I always receive\nemails asking me how
    I can have a guy ranked highly on the cheatsheet but\nlisted under a matchup that
    favors the Defense.   Just because one matchup\nmay be more favorable than another,
    that doesn't necessarily mean I'd start\nthe player with the best matchup.   Ahman
    Green may have a horrible matchup\none week but unless you're sitting on Ricky
    Williams or Marshall Faulk,\nGreen's your guy no matter who he's lining up against.
    \ (Yes, even after\nlast week's performance)  The matchup info is meant to be
    just one more tool\nin your box when it comes to deciding between players.\n\nStats
    are provided by Mike Hall's excellent FLM League Management Software.\nhttp://www.fflm.com/
    for more info.   Fantasy Points Allowed by position\nnumbers are from ESPN.com.
    \  Target numbers are from our Footballguy Andy\nHicks.\nLet's get to it.\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\n\nLocks:
    \ These games feature Defenses that should be overmatched against the\nOffense.\n\n\nJacksonville's
    Stacey Mack vs Minnesota Defense\n\nStacey Mack played well last week rushing
    for 115 yards on 28 carries (4.1\nypc).   He's settling into the starting RB role
    pretty well.   Still very\nquiet on the Fred Taylor front so you have to assume
    Mack's going to keep\nhis job.   With no playoff hopes, it probably makes sense
    not to rush Taylor\nback.   Mack will face an ultra soft Viking defense this week
    ranked # 31 in\nRushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks.   For
    the year,\nthey rank # 30 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.\n\n\nNew York Jet's
    Curtis Martin vs Indianapolis Defense\n\nCurtis Martin ran hard last week.   He
    had 78 yards on 24 carries (3.2 ypc)\nplus he caught a couple of passes.   This
    might be his week though as the\nColts are weak on defense ranking # 28 in Rushing
    Yards Allowed per Game\nover the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank #
    31 in Fantasy Points\nAllowed to RBs.   If he's going to explode, this is the
    week.\n\n\nSt. Louis' Marshall Faulk vs Carolina Defense\n\nStart Faulk.   End
    of story.   He's the best player in Fantasy Football.\nIf it matters (and it doesn't)
    the Panthers rank # 24 in Rushing Yards\nAllowed per Game over the last 4 weeks
    and # 29 in Fantasy Points Allowed to\nRBs.   Faulk's knee was described as \"puffy\"
    after the game but he insists\nhe'll be fine and play.   Although some are saying
    Trung Canidate will see\nincreased time.   He's still a must start in my opinion
    though.\n\n\nTennessee's Eddie George / Skip Hicks vs Oakland Defense\n\nThis
    one hurts.   Eddie George owners have been circling on their calendars\nthe Oakland
    game with their porous rush defense.   And then Skip Hicks comes\nin last week
    and looks like Earl Campbell rushing for 142 yards on 17\ncarries (8.4 ypc) and
    a score   (Granted, those numbers are padded with a 51\nyard rush)   George is
    such a team player that he reportedly didn't mind\nHicks staying in the game as
    he had the hot hand.   I think you'll see\nGeorge back this week in his regular
    role but Hicks could get the call at\nany time.   The Raiders have improved on
    defense.   Now they just rank # 30\nin Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the
    last four weeks.   For the year,\nthey rank # 24 in Fantasy Points Allowed to
    RBs.\n\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\n\nPrime Matchups:
    \ These games feature Defenses that should have trouble\nstopping the Offense.\n\n\nAtlanta's
    Maurice Smith / Bob Christian vs Buffalo Defense\n\nMaurice looked a little better
    (or healthier) this week but he's still\nunderperforming.   He rushed 11 times
    for 49 yards (4.5 ypc) Sunday.   Bob\nChristian is clearly going to be more involved
    at RB.   He had 7 rushes for\n17 yards (2.4 ypc) and a score.   Christian also
    tacked on 66 yards\nreceiving.   At this point, I'd say Christian deserves a look
    in larger\nleagues.   The Bill Defense is pretty weak ranking # 27 in Rushing
    Yards\nAllowed per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 28
    in\nFantasy Points Allowed to RBs.\n\n\nChicago's Anthony Thomas vs Washington
    Defense\n\nWith 31 carries last week for 173 yards (5.6 ypc), I think it's safe
    to say\nThomas is back.   He's a perfect fit for this conservative offense.   Plus\nthe
    Bear's defense looks like it'll keep them in most games which keeps\nThomas involved.
    \  He'll face a Redskin defense that ranks # 19 in Rushing\nYards Allowed per
    Game over the last 4 weeks and # 26 in Fantasy Points\nAllowed to RBs.\n\n\nGreen
    Bay's Ahman Green vs Cleveland Defense\n\nIt's my opinion that Ahman Green owners
    should just forget about last week.\nGreen was held to just 9 yards on 9 carries
    by a surging Tennessee defense.\nI see very little to make me think this wasn't
    an aberration.   This week,\nhe'll face a softer Brown defense that's ranked #
    14 in Rushing Yards\nAllowed per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year,
    Cleveland is\nranked # 20 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.   Fantasy Football
    owners\ntraditionally have memories that last about 7 days.   I personally am
    not\nletting last weeks performance wipe out what has been a great year.\n\n\nIndianapolis'
    Dominic Rhodes vs New York Jets Defense\n\nIt's too early to be talking about
    Edgerrin James being a product of the\n\"system\" but the truth of the matter
    is that no name Dominic Rhodes is\ntearing it up lately.   He's had 298 rushing
    yards over the last 3 games.\nSunday, he rolled for 177 of them on 29 carries
    (6.1 ypc)   (and his longest\nrun was 35 yards so it's not like he padded the
    stats with a 80 yarder)   He\ncaught 3 passes to boot.   Clearly, he's playing
    at a high level right now\nand is a must start in most leagues.   The Jets were
    horrible early on\nagainst the run but have now improved to average ranking #
    17 in Rushing\nYards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they
    rank # 25\nin Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.\n\n\nNew England's Antowain Smith
    vs Miami Defense\n\nYou know Antowain Smith had fun against his old team Sunday
    when he rolled\nup 95 yards on 20 carries (4.8 ypc)   He continues to be one of
    the better\nstories of 2001.   Over the last 3 weeks, he ranks as the # 8 RB in
    Fantasy\npoints per game.   Smith should have had a TD but went down at the 2.
    \  This\nweek, he'll face a Dolphin Defense that's been soft lately.   They rank
    # 26\nin Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year,\nthey
    rank # 11 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.\n\n\nNew Orleans' Ricky Williams /
    Deuce McAllister vs Tampa Bay Defense\n\nWilliams had a sub par game Monday night
    and it does seem like Coach Jim\nHaslett has been looking the other way the last
    few games.   He only had 14\ncarries Monday.   He did gain 57 yards (4.1 ypc)
    so he did well when he was\nin there.   Some of that can be attributed to the
    Rams and their offense\ntaking Williams out.   Although you can't ignore Deuce
    McAllister.\nMcAllister had 5 catches for 44 yards (but just one carry)   The
    Bucs are\nnothing special lately ranking # 21 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game
    over\nthe last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 15 in Fantasy Points Allowed\nto
    RBs.   Keep an eye on Tampa's Warren Sapp who missed a good bit of time\nlast
    week with a shoulder injury.   It'd be a nice boost if he's less than\n100%.\n\n\nNew
    York Giants' Tiki Barber / Ron Dayne vs Seattle Defense\n\nBarber continues to
    steal the show from Ron Dayne.   Barber rushed 16 times\nfor 85 yards (5.3 ypc)
    \  Dayne only had 4 carries for 9 yards.   Barber was\nalso the Giant's leading
    receiver with 5 receptions.   I don't see that\nchanging a lot.   Seattle is ranked
    # 29 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game\nover the last four weeks.   For the year,
    they rank # 13 in Fantasy Points\nAllowed to RBs.\n\n\nSan Francisco's Garrison
    Hearst vs Philadelphia Defense\n\nGarrison Hearst continues to be one of the best
    stories in the league.   He\nran for 103 yards on 26 carries Sunday (4.0 ypc)
    \  You have to be a little\nworried about him though as Kevan Barlow got both
    rushing TDs.   And both\nTerry Jackson and Fred Beasley saw red zone carries.
    \  Hearst will be a guy\nwho runs up and down the field but it looks like coach
    Steve Mariucci has\nmore faith in the other guys for the goalline.   The Eagles
    rank # 23 in\nRushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks.   For the
    year,\nthey rank # 10 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.\n\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\n\nEven
    Matchups:  These games feature no real advantage either way\n\n\nArizona's Michael
    Pittman / Thomas Jones vs Dallas Defense\n\nThings are looking pretty bad for
    Michael Pittman owners.   As we commented\nearlier, the carries allotted to Jones
    have been creeping up.   Last week,\nit looked more like a full blown time share
    with Pittman running 14 times\nfor 37 yards (2.6 ypc) and Jones totaling 24 yards
    on 12 carries (2.0 ypc)\nClearly, neither are any good but that's bad news for
    Pittman owners.   Of\neven more concern is the fact that Jones is looking like
    the short yardage /\nred zone guy.   The Cowboys rank # 25 in Rushing Yards Allowed
    per Game over\nthe last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 14 in Fantasy Points
    Allowed\nto RBs.   It's tough right now to put much faith in either guy though,
    even\nwith the favorable matchup.\n\n\nBuffalo's Shawn Bryson vs Atlanta Defense\n\nTravis
    Henry's tough rookie year continued Sunday as he injured his knee.\nShawn Bryson
    will likely get the bulk of the work this week.   Bryson didn't\ndo much Sunday
    running 14 times for 38 yards (2.7 ypc)   He did catch 3\npasses.   He'll likely
    be better with a week of practice with the first\nunit.   The Falcons haven't
    been anything special against the run lately\nranking # 22 in Rushing Yards Allowed
    per Game over the last 4 weeks and #\n21 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs for
    the year.\n\n\nDallas' Emmitt Smith vs Arizona Defense\n\nEmmitt Smith looked
    like the \"old\" Emmitt Smith.  \"Old\" as in 2001 version\nwhich means not very
    good.   He struggled to get 39 yards on 12 carries (3.2\nypc) and generally wasn't
    a factor.   He's an up and down player so realize\nyour taking a chance with him.
    \  The Cardinals aren't much on defense\nranking # 20 in Rushing Yards Allowed
    per Game over the last four weeks.\nFor the year, they rank # 23 in Fantasy Points
    Allowed to RBs.\n\n\nMiami's Lamar Smith vs New England Defense\n\nLamar Smith
    is a grinder type back that needs lots of carries to be\neffective.   He only
    rushed 9 times Sunday for 22 yards (2.4 ypc)   That\nwon't get it done.   Travis
    Minor is a threat but it looks to me like the\nDolphins will stay with Smith for
    now.   New England ranks # 13 in Rushing\nYards Allowed per Game over the last
    four weeks.   For the year, they rank #\n16 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.\n\n\nPittsburgh's
    Chris Fuamatu-Ma'afala / Jerome Bettis / Amos Zereoue vs\nDetroit Defense\n\nAmos
    Zereoue had a pretty good game against Baltimore with 73 yards on 16\ncarries
    (4.6 ypc)   But he hurt his shoulder and is now questionable for\nthis week's
    game.   Fuamatu-Ma'afala ran hard but had little room to move\ngaining 15 yards
    on 9 carries (1.7 ypc)   And finally, Jerome Bettis is in\nthe mix although the
    early word has him as doubtful again for this week's\ngame.   Obviously, they're
    being very careful to preserve him for the\nplayoffs.   We'll try to stay on this
    story this week for you.   The Lions\nare surprisingly tough against the run lately
    ranking # 11 in Rushing Yards\nAllowed per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the
    year, they rank # 22 in\nFantasy Points Allowed to RBs.\n\n\nSan Diego's LaDainian
    Tomlinson vs Kansas City Defense\n\nTomlinson struggled a bit last week with just
    46 yards on 17 carries (2.7\nypc)   He did add 23 yards on 6 catches.   He'll
    face an improved KC defense\nthis week ranked # 8 in Rushing Yards Allowed per
    Game over the last four\nweeks.   For the year, they rank # 27 in Fantasy Points
    Allowed to RBs.\n\n\nSeattle's Shaun Alexander vs New York Giants Defense\n\nIt's
    been an up and down last couple of weeks for Alexander owners but with\nRicky
    Watters broken ankle, Alexander is back in the saddle as the # 1 Guy.\nLook for
    him to pick up where he left off.   Last week, he rushed for 27\nyards on 7 carries
    (3.9 ypc) plus a TD.   The Giants have been pretty\naverage lately in stopping
    the run ranking # 15 in Rushing Yards Allowed per\nGame over the last four weeks.
    \  For the year, they rank # 2 in Fantasy\nPoints Allowed to RBs.\n\n\nWashington's
    Stephen Davis vs Chicago Defense\n\nStephen Davis played well last week with 111
    yards on 24 carries (4.6 ypc)\nHe was one of the few bright spots for Washington.
    \  This week, he faces a\ntough but beatable Bear defense that ranks # 16 in Rushing
    Yards Allowed per\nGame over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank #
    9 in Fantasy\nPoints Allowed to RBs.\n\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\n\nDownside
    Matchups:  These games feature a Defense that could pose trouble\nfor the Offense.\n\n\nBaltimore's
    Moe Williams / Terry Allen vs Cincinnati Defense\n\nYou know it's not good when
    Obafemi Ayanbadejo leads the team in rushing\nyards and Elvis Grbac leads the
    team in rushing TDs.   But that's what\nhappened Sunday against the Steelers.
    \ ( I wonder if Ray Lewis thinks the\nSteelers have a \"real defense\" yet?)   Moe
    Williams logged 15 yards on 4\ncarries (3.8 ypc) and Terry Allen made a less than
    smashing debut with 3\nyards on 3 carries (you do the math)   Tough to say how
    it'll be split this\nweek but you'd have to think Allen will see more time.   The
    Bengals aren't\nas good as Pittsburgh, but they're very good ranking # 4 in Rushing
    Yards\nAllowed per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 4 in\nFantasy
    Points Allowed to RBs.   Tough matchup especially since it's not yet\nclear how
    the carries will be split.\n\nCleveland's James Jackson / Jamel White vs Green
    Bay Defense\n\nWatch this one closely this week as Jackson tweaked his troublesome
    ankle\nagain.   He could be ok, but it's not clear early this week.   If he can't\ngo,
    I'd expect you'll see Jamel White over Ben Gay as Gay has made more than\nhis
    share of mistakes.   Whoever runs will be facing the suddenly vulnerable\nPackers
    who rank # 18 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4\nweeks.   For
    the year, they rank # 8 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.\n\n\nKansas City's Priest
    Holmes / Tony Richardson vs San Diego Defense\n\nWe had Holmes ranked # 5 last
    week.  I'm guessing you'll see more sites\nfollow our lead and raise him up the
    charts as well.   He had a monster game\n(again) with 121 yards on 29 carries
    (4.2 ypc) plus the score.   He's a must\nstart against pretty much any defense.
    \  This week, he'll face a San Diego\nteam ranked # 6 in Rushing Yards Allowed
    per Game over the last four weeks.\nFor the year, they rank # 7 in Fantasy Points
    Allowed to RBs.   Still\nthough, I wouldn't let that stop me.   Do keep an eye
    on his health this\nweek as he's nursing a sore groin that might limit him.\n\n\nMinnesota's
    Michael Bennett vs Jacksonville Defense\n\nOutside of Indianapolis, I don't know
    that there's been a more disappointing\nthan Minnesota.   Or one tougher to predict
    each week.   You get fired up on\nMichael Bennett and then he cools off.   Last
    week, he was back to his early\nseason workload with only 10 carries.   He did
    gain 40 yards (4.0 ypc) so\nwhen he ran, he did fine.   With him, it's a numbers
    game.   Give him enough\ncarries and eventually he'll break one.   But 10 opportunities
    won't do it.\nAnd he'll face a very tough Jacksonville defense that's been hot
    lately.\nThey rank # 2 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks.\nFor
    the year, they rank # 12 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.\n\n\nOakland's Charlie
    Garner vs Tennessee Defense\n\nCharlie Garner had his usual productive day with
    68 yards rushing on 19\ncarries (3.6 ypc) plus another 45 yards receiving.   The
    big news was Tyrone\nWheatley not getting a carry.   Looks like Zack Crockett
    is back in at the\ngoalline.   Although that can change at any moment.   The Titans
    shut down\nAhman Green last week so that's a worry.   They rank # 9 in Rushing
    Yards\nAllowed per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank #
    17 in\nFantasy Points Allowed to RBs.\n\n\nPhiladelphia's Duce Staley vs San Francisco
    Defense\n\nStaley continues to salvage his rushing numbers with his contributions
    in\nthe passing game.   He rushed 15 times for 36 yards Sunday (2.4 ypc)   He\nalso
    had 2 fumbles.   But on the bright side, he caught 8 passes for 73\nyards.   They'll
    find the going a little tougher this week against San\nFrancisco ranked # 5 in
    Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four\nweeks.   For the year, they
    rank # 19 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.\n\n\nTampa Bay's Warrick Dunn / Mike
    Alstott vs New Orleans Defense\n\nYou'll go crazy trying to figure out which one
    of these guys will do\nanything week to week.   Dunn only had 10 carries for 27
    yards (2.7 ypc) and\nAlstott only managed 7 rushes for 23 yards (3.3 ypc)   Dunn
    was heavily\ninvolved in the Tampa Dink and Dunk passing game but that's tough
    to count\non.   They'll face a New Orleans defense that's likely smarting from
    the\nRams defeat.   They rank # 7 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last\n4
    weeks.   For the year, they rank # 18 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.\n\n\n\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\n\nDefensive
    Slam Dunks:  These games feature a very tough Defense posing major\nproblems for
    the Offense.\n\n\nCarolina's Richard Huntley vs St. Louis Defense\n\nHuntley should
    be rested after the bye week.   Unfortunately, rest won't\nmake him any more talented.
    \  The Rams rank # 10 in Rushing Yards Allowed\nper Game over the last 4 weeks
    and # 5 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs so\nthis isn't looking good.\n\n\nCincinnati's
    Corey Dillon vs Baltimore Defense\n\nIt's strength against strength this week
    with Dillon facing the Ravens.   If\nyou can imagine it, the Bengals will be hurting
    without Akili Smith at QB...\nThat means Dillon is the whole offense and you can
    bet the Ravens will be\ngeared up for it.   On a forward looking note, it doesn't
    get any easier for\nDillon as he has Tennessee and Pittsburgh on the horizon.
    \  If your trade\ndeadline hasn't passed, I'd consider dealing him.   The Ravens
    rank # 12 in\nRushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks but I think
    they're\nbetter than that.   They rank # 3 for the year in Fantasy Points Allowed
    to\nRBs.\n\n\nDetroit's James Stewart vs Pittsburgh Defense\n\nJames Stewart's
    hip injury may not be as bad as feared.   He had a solid\ngame in their first
    victory last week rushing for 91 yards on 20 carries\n(4.6 ypc)   The awful news
    this week is that he's playing Pittsburgh.   The\nSteelers are dominating offenses
    right now ranking # 1 in Rushing Yards\nAllowed per Game over the last four weeks.
    \  For the year, they rank # 1 in\nFantasy Points Allowed to RBs.\n\n\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\n\nThat'll

  subject: ! '[Footballguys] Update - Bettis Considering Sitting Last Two Regular
    Games'
  body: ! "Entire story:\nhttp://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/tribune-review/sports/steelerslive/s_9838.ht\nml\n\n\nFrom
    the Jerry DiPaola article:   Steelers running back Jerome Bettis missed\npractice
    Wednesday, and later said he might not need to play in the final\ntwo regular-season
    games to be ready for the first playoff game Jan. 19 or\n20.\n\nBettis has missed
    the past three games with a serious groin injury that he\ndescribed to David Letterman
    last week as \"like splitting your pants, but\nyou're splitting your body.\"\n\n\"Do
    you need to (play)? Need is a strong word,\" Bettis said yesterday after\nwatching
    his teammates practice. \"Would you like to get a little work in?\nJust a little
    bit, nothing strenuous. But you would like to get a little\nwork in if you could.\n\n\"But
    if you can't, I don't think it precludes you from playing (in the\nplayoffs).\"\n\nBettis
    said that he didn't know if he would practice today or play Sunday in\nCincinnati,
    but he will base his availability on how he feels.\n\n\"You want to take care
    of the injury first and if that means not playing,\nthat means not playing,\"
    he said. \"But you want to make sure you're healed\nup. The team playing as well
    as it has played allows me the opportunity to\nget healthy. I'm using it very,
    very wisely.\n\n\"What I do know is if you don't play, there is going to be a
    certain amount\nof rust associated with not having played. The key is to minimize
    the rust.\nThis is nine years in. I'm not going to miss much.\"\n\n************
    \ Our View  ****************\n\nPretty much sums it up right there.   Clearly,
    Bettis is a large risk here.\nStay tuned to see how he progresses but even if
    he were to start, there's\nalways that very real risk that he'd pull himself out
    if he felt a twinge.\n\nThanks to Footballguy Greg Lizotte for pointing me to
    this one.\n\nJoe\n\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\nBryant

  subject: Metro Bus Passes and Woodlands Express Passes Available Effective Friday,
    December 28, 2001
  body: ! "\nEnron employees not participating in contract parking are eligible to
    receive Metro Bus Passes or Woodlands Express Passes.  You may pick up a bus pass
    from the Parking & Transportation Desk, on Level 3 of the Enron Building, from
    8:30 AM to 4:30 PM. \n\n\nAll Metro passes offered through the Enron Parking &
    Transportation desk will be the Metro 30 Day Zone Pass.  When you use a 30-day
    zone pass, bus service is divided into four zones w/ unlimited rides.  The zone
    pass is time activated, which means that it will not become active until the first
    time it is used and will not expire until 30 days after it was used for the first
    time.  New passes will be available to Enron employees upon expiration of the
    30 day time period. Each zone does have a different fare values based on the distance
    the bus travels. This is important to any buser who wants to transfer to or travel
    in a higher-cost zone than the zone pass they have, in this case the difference
    must be paid in cash.  If they are traveling in a lower cost zone, then there
    is no extra cost.  \n\nParking & Transportation Desk\n3-7060"

    off than with cheap airfares. We\nhave been able to keep several of our low cost
    airfares around the world.\nOur new exclusive low fares to Europe for April through
    May and June\nthrough August departures are flying out the window (at 60 percent
    off,\nwhy not?), so you'd better act fast for this special. With temperatures\nacross
    the Northeast below 40 degrees and all the feet of snow that\nBuffalo has, think
    85-degree weather from $218 roundtrip to Nassau,\nFreeport or Bermuda and $298
    roundtrip or less to the Dominican Republic,\nMontego Bay, San Juan or Grand Cayman
    through February 13, 2002. We also\nhave specials to Asia, Europe, Canada (think
    skiing) and Central and South\nAmerica. We have so many great travel bargains
    that have been extended; we\ndon't know where to start. Also, on Wednesday, January
    2, 2002, watch our\nemail for one heck of a three-day sale! Read the stories listed

    on the injury report as questionable with a sore back.  \nDerrick mason and Kevin
    Tyson remain the starters.  \n\nMichael Westbrook (Was) is expected to start opposite
    of Rod Gardner \ndespite a sore knee.  He appears on the injury report as probable.\n\n******************************************************\n\nTight
    Ends in the News:\n\nShannon Sharpe (Bal) is listed as probable with a sore leg
    on the \ninjury report, but he is expected to start as usual.\n\nWesley Walls
    (Car) was unable to practice on Thursday.  He remains \nvery questionable with
    a sore knee.  If he does play, the decision is \nexpected right before gametime.
    \ Kris Magnum would start if walls \ncannot go. \n\nAaron Shea (Cle) has been
    placed on I/R and is lost for the season.\n\nDesmon Clark (Den) practiced on Thursday
    and is expected to start.  \nHe appears on the injury report as probable with
    a sore groin.\n\nTyrone Davis (GB) has moved ahead of rookie David Martin on the
    depth \nchart.  Bubba Franks remains the starter and the best endzone option \nof
    the three.  Tyrone will be used in double tight end sets.\n\nCam Cleeland (NO)
    was placed on I/R and is lost for the season.  \nEddie \"Boo\" Williams will start
    in his place.\n\nGreg Clark (SF) is out with a torn hamstring.\n\nStephen Alexander
    (was) has been placed on I/R and is gone for the \nseason.  Zeron Flemister will
    start in his place.\n\n******************************************************\n\nKickers

    for Martin Gramatica who is questionable with a hamstring \ninjury.  \n\nMartin
    Gramatica (TB) was not able to practice on Thursday, but is \nrecovering quickly.

    kickoff.\n\n\n\n\nTo unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\ncheatsheets-unsubscribe@egroups.com\n\n

    Folks,\n\nHere's how I see the Passing Game Matchups this week.\n\nPLEASE NOTE:
    \  See the cheatsheets online at www.footballguys.com  for\nexactly where I rank
    players and to determine who to start.   I always\nreceive emails asking me how
    I can have a guy ranked highly on the\ncheatsheet but listed under a matchup that
    favors the Defense.   Just\nbecause one matchup may be more favorable than another,
    that doesn't\nnecessarily mean I'd start the player with the best matchup.   Jeff
    Garcia\nmay have a horrible matchup one week but unless you're sitting on Kurt\nWarner
    or Brett Favre, Garcia's your guy no matter who he's lining up\nagainst.   The
    matchup info is meant to be just one more tool in your box\nwhen it comes to deciding
    between players.\n\nNote:  I've used the player stats sorted by performance over
    the last four\nweeks extensively in developing these write-ups. Stats are provided
    by Mike\nHall's excellent FLM League Management Software.  http://www.fflm.com/
    for\nmore info.   The points scored by position data is from ESPN.com.\nLet's

    Game Matchups to Avoid and Exploit\n\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\nLocks:
    \ These games feature Defenses that have struggled lately.\n\n\nArizona Passing
    Game vs Carolina Defense\n\nJake Plummer came up small last week with just 144
    yards against a hot\nDallas pass Defense.   Surprisingly, David Boston was a non
    factor with just\n26 yards.   Although he still had a ton of balls thrown his
    way so there's\nnothing to worry about.   Carolina ranks # 30 in Passing Yards
    Allowed Per\nGame over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 28 in
    Fantasy\nPoints Allowed to QBs and # 22 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.\n\n\nCleveland
    Passing Game vs Tennessee Defense\n\nTim Couch threw for 203 yards and a TD last
    week against Green Bay which was\nthe 12th best day among QBs last week ahead
    of guys like Manning, McNair and\nGarcia.   Clearly, the matchup helped him out.
    \  Kevin Johnson, as usual,\nwas his primary target although it was good to see
    RB Jamel White involved\nin the passing game with lots of passes thrown his way.
    \  The Titans have\nbeen awful lately against the pass ranking # 29 in Passing
    Yards Allowed Per\nGame over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank #
    30 in Fantasy\nPoints Allowed to QBs and # 31 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.
    \  Again,\nsome people have a hard time understanding what these matchups provide
    - I'm\nnot saying Couch will have a great game.   Check the cheatsheet rankings
    for\nwhere we have him.   What I'm saying is that he has a great matchup here\nagainst
    the Titans who've struggled against the pass all year.\n\n\nMiami Passing Game
    vs Atlanta Defense\n\nJay Fiedler exploded for 320 yards and a TD last week.   Finally,\nFootballguy
    Favorite Chris Chambers got a start and delivered big time with\n124 yards on
    7 receptions.   He did tweak an ankle but is expected to be ok\nthis week.   TE
    Jed Weaver also saw lots of passes thrown his way.   The\nFalcons rank # 31 in
    Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four\nweeks.   For the year, they
    rank # 29 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and #\n30 in Fantasy Points Allowed
    to WRs.\n\n\nNew York Jets Passing Game vs Buffalo Defense\n\nVinny Testeverde
    refuses to fade away.   He rolled up 285 yards and 2 TDs\n(with 2 Interceptions)
    against Indy Sunday.   Wayne Chrebet was the primary\nWR with Laveranues Coles
    seeing less action.   TE Anthony Becht produced\nanother TD.   The Bills rank
    # 27 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the\nlast four weeks.   For the year,
    they rank # 24 in Fantasy Points Allowed to\nQBs and # 20 in Fantasy Points Allowed
    to WRs.\n\n\nSt. Louis Passing Game vs Indianapolis Defense\n\nKurt Warner had
    an \"off\" day for him with \"just\" 217 yards and 2 TDs.   Of\ncourse, he's a
    must start every week.   The trouble with him is he spreads\nthe ball around so
    well, it's tough to predict which WR will see action but\nI'd have a very hard
    time benching guys like Holt, Bruce or even Proehl.\nKeep an eye on the thumb
    he tweaked but he's saying he's ok.   The Colts\nrank # 28 in Passing Yards Allowed
    Per Game over the last four weeks.   For\nthe year, they rank # 27 in Fantasy
    Points Allowed to QBs and # 27 in\nFantasy Points Allowed to WRs.\n\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\nPrime
    Matchups:  These games feature Defenses that haven't been strong\nlately.\n\n\nChicago
    Passing Game vs Detroit Defense\n\nMarty Booker catching 74 yards worth of passes
    isn't as remarkable until you\nrealize QB Jim Miller only threw for 98 yards.
    \  I guess that makes Booker\nthe # 1 WR...   He's clearly the favored option.
    \  This team is all about\nAnthony Thomas and their defense though so I'm not
    too excited about any of\nthese guys outside of Booker even with the matchup.
    \  The Lions rank # 22 in\nPassing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.
    \  For the year,\nthey rank # 31 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 29 in
    Fantasy Points\nAllowed to WRs.\n\n\nGreen Bay Passing Game vs Minnesota Defense\n\nBrett
    Favre made the most out of 139 yards throwing for 3 TDs last week.\nHe's too good
    to sit against anyone.   Antonio Freeman and Billy Schroeder\nare solid options
    and Bubba Franks seems to have picked up where he was\nearlier this year.   The
    Vikings rank # 17 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game\nover the last four weeks.
    \  For the year, they rank # 21 in Fantasy Points\nAllowed to QBs and # 24 in
    Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.\n\n\nIndianapolis Passing Game vs St. Louis Defense\n\nManning
    was back on track again with 228 yards, 1 TD and 0 Interceptions\nlast week.   The
    interceptions have hurt him this year but the fact is he's\nstill one of the leagues
    best QBs.   Marvin Harrison was incredible catching\nnearly everything in his
    sight.   The Rams rank # 24 in Passing Yards\nAllowed Per Game over the last four
    weeks.  Remember, Chris Weinke rolled\nover them last week.   For the year, they
    rank # 15 in Fantasy Points\nAllowed to QBs and # 8 in Fantasy Points Allowed
    to WRs.\n\n\nOakland Passing Game vs Denver Passing Game\n\nIt's funny when people
    get excited about Gannon throwing just 249 yards but\nthat's what's happening.
    \  He's spoiled us.   I'm not worried about him as\nalong with Jerry Rice and
    Tim Brown, they're still one of the better passing\nunits in the game.   Charlie
    Garner is a nice target too.   This week,\nthey'll face a suddenly vulnerable
    Denver team that ranks # 23 in Passing\nYards Allowed Per Game over the last four
    weeks.   For the year, they rank #\n9 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 25
    in Fantasy Points Allowed to\nWRs.\n\n\nTampa Bay Passing Game vs Baltimore Defense\n\nBrad
    Johnson put together a great game with 3 TDs and 0 Interceptions on 207\nyards.
    \  Keyshawn Johnson is of course the receiver of choice and outside of\nhim, I
    don't see many other viable FF options.   Johnson to Johnson is the\nname of this
    passing game.   Baltimore ranks # 26 in Passing Yards Allowed\nPer Game over the
    last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 17 in Fantasy\nPoints Allowed to
    QBs and # 19 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\n\nEven
    Matchups:  These games feature no real advantage either way\n\n\nCarolina Passing
    Game vs Arizona Defense\n\nWeinke's 312 yard day last week against the Rams was
    surprising as the Rams\nwere ranked as the # 9 passing defense over the last 4
    weeks going into last\nweek.   Donald Hayes was ultra active and may need to be
    again this week as\nMuhsin Muhammad is very iffy and TE Wesley Walls tweaked his
    knee.   The\nCardinals rank # 14 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last
    four\nweeks.   For the year, they rank # 26 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and
    #\n26 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.\n\n\nDenver Passing Game vs Oakland Defense\n\nBrian
    Griese should be back and ready to go.   Gus Frerotte is out for the\nyear so
    Jarius Jackson will be the # 2 guy.   Rod Smith is the only receiver\nof note
    and he's a guy you can never count out.   The bye week helped and\nhe's reportedly
    feeling better than he has in a while.   Oakland has\nstruggled lately on defense
    ranking # 21 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game\nover the last four weeks.   For
    the year, they rank # 10 in Fantasy Points\nAllowed to QBs and # 13 in Fantasy
    Points Allowed to WRs.\n\n\nJacksonville Passing Game vs Kansas City Defense\n\nBrunell
    had a Brunell-like day last week with 217 yards and a TD.   Jimmy\nSmith is a
    must start and Keenan McCardell deserves a hard look in just\nabout any league.
    \  The Chiefs rank # 18 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game\nover the last four
    weeks.   For the year, they rank # 14 in Fantasy Points\nAllowed to QBs and #
    12 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.\n\n\nKansas City Passing Game vs Jacksonville
    Defense\n\nTrent Green put together a decent day with 203 yards, 1 TD and 2\nInterceptions.
    \  Snoop Minnis was the preferred WR while Derrick Alexander\ndid very little.
    \  Tony Gonzalez was fairly involved although not as much as\nhis owners would
    like to see.   He's still a must start for TE leagues.\nThe Jaguars rank # 20
    in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four\nweeks.   For the year, they
    rank # 19 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and #\n6 in Fantasy Points Allowed
    to WRs.\n\n\nMinnesota Passing Game vs Green Bay Defense\n\nStay tuned this week
    for whether Todd Bouman or Spergon Wynn gets the call.\nThe Vikings have imploded.
    \  If Bouman starts, it's much better news for\nMoss.   If Wynn starts, Cris Carter
    seemed to be the favored target.\nAlthough it was pretty clear that they were
    forcing the ball to Carter\nbecause it could've been his last game in Minnesota.
    \  Honestly, it's tough\nto sit Cris Carter or Randy Moss regardless of who is
    at QB.   WRs are\nrarely a sure thing.   The Packers rank # 19 in Passing Yards
    Allowed Per\nGame over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 12 in
    Fantasy\nPoints Allowed to QBs and # 5 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.\n\n\nPhiladelphia
    Passing Game vs New York Giants Defense\n\nThe Eagle passing game is all about
    McNabb to RB Duce Staley now.   Good for\nStaley owners but not the ideal situation
    for McNabb.   James Thrash and\nFreddie Mitchell saw most of the action at WR
    but they weren't too\neffective.   Todd Pinkston is in the mix which makes it
    even tougher to pick\na WR.   The Giants may be without Jason Sehorn this week
    which would be big.\nThey rank # 6 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the
    last four weeks.\nFor the year, they rank # 18 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs
    and # 28 in\nFantasy Points Allowed to WRs.\n\n\nPittsburgh Passing Game vs Cincinnati
    Defense\n\nKordell Stewart continues to prove his critics wrong as he rolled up
    3 TDs\nlast week and 221 yards.   There's serious MVP talk about him and deservedly\nso.
    \  WRs Hines Ward and Plaxico Burress both deserve a look for most any\nteam.
    \  Burress, in particular, is coming on lately.   The Bengals are\ntougher than
    many realize against the pass lately.   They rank # 7 in\nPassing Yards Allowed
    Per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year,\nthey rank # 16 in Fantasy
    Points Allowed to QBs and # 21 in Fantasy Points\nAllowed to WRs.\n\n\nSan Diego
    Passing Game vs Seattle Defense\n\nDoug Flutie was awful early, but made a great
    recovery to finish with 175\nyards and 2 TDs with no Interceptions.   There's
    a lot of talk about letting\nDrew Brees see action with the season basically over
    but one has to think we\nwould've seen him last week if that was the case.   Either
    way, Flutie's\nprobably not worthy of a start except for the larger leagues.   Of
    the WRs,\nCurtis Conway was clearly the go to guy with TE Freddie Jones seeing
    action\nas well.   The Seahawks rank # 9 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over
    the\nlast four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 23 in Fantasy Points Allowed
    to\nQBs and # 17 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.\n\n\nSeattle Passing Game vs
    San Diego Defense\n\nMatt Hasselbeck hasn't carried many FF Teams this season
    and I doubt it'll\nstart now.   He's still a below average player.   WRs Koren
    Robinson and\nDarrell Jackson are the primary guys while Shaun Alexander will
    be involved\nin the passing game as well.   The Chargers rank # 15 in Passing
    Yards\nAllowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank #
    22 in\nFantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 15 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.\n\n\nWashington
    Passing Game vs New Orleans Defense\n\nTony Banks threw for 236 yards last week
    in a tough game with Chicago.\nMichael Westbrook and Rod Gardner both saw roughly
    equal numbers of passes\nthrown their way.   He only caught a couple, but TE Zeron
    Felmister saw 6\npasses thrown his way.   You could do a lot worse for a TE.   Plus,
    he's got\na cool name...   The Saints rank # 13 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game
    over\nthe last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 25 in Fantasy Points\nAllowed
    to QBs and # 23 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.\n\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\n\nDownside
    Matchups:  These games feature a Defense that's been pretty strong\nlately.\n\n\nBuffalo
    Passing Game vs New York Jets Defense\n\nVan Pelt put together a 208 yard / 1
    TD passing game last week.   As usual,\nEric Moulds and Peerless Price were featured
    fairly evenly.   This week, the\nBills face a pretty tough Jets team that ranks
    # 11 in Passing Yards Allowed\nPer Game over the last four weeks.   For the year,
    they rank # 1 in Fantasy\nPoints Allowed to QBs and # 4 in Fantasy Points Allowed
    to WRs.\n\n\nDallas Passing Game vs San Francisco Defense\n\nI can't imagine you're
    in contention in week 16 with many of these guys on\nthe roster.   Quincy Carter's
    given me very little to make me think he'll do\nmuch of anything.   Of course,
    for the gamblers, Rocket Ismail or Joey\nGalloway can make something happen with
    just one throw, but they're definite\nrisks.   San Francisco is ranked # 8 in
    Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over\nthe last four weeks.   For the year, they
    rank # 13 in Fantasy Points\nAllowed to QBs and # 18 in Fantasy Points Allowed
    to WRs.\n\n\nDetroit Passing Game vs Chicago Defense\n\nRookie Mike McMahon gave
    a valiant effort but it's still very clear he's a\nrookie QB.   Granted, he's
    got talent and potential but he's still very\ngreen.   Johnnie Morton is the WR
    of choice but TE David Sloan actually saw\nmore balls thrown his way last week
    than any other Lion receiver.   That's\nnot unusual for a new QB to focus on the
    shorter routes of a TE and it could\ncontinue.   The Bears rank # 12 in Passing
    Yards Allowed Per Game over the\nlast four weeks.  For the year, they rank # 8
    in Fantasy Points Allowed to\nQBs and # 2 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.\n\n\nNew
    Orleans Passing Game vs Washington Defense\n\nFew people expected Tampa Bay to
    start a track meet with New Orleans last\nweek but that's what happened.   Aaron
    Brooks had 3 TDs late as the Saints\ntried to rally from a big deficit.   Stats
    are stats though and Brooks\nowners will take them any way they can get them.
    \  Joe Horn and Willie\nJackson saw tons of action.   With Cam Cleeland shockingly
    injured again,\nBoo Williams is back as the # 1 TE so that's good news.   The
    Redskins rank\n# 4 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.
    \  For the\nyear, they rank # 5 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 11 in Fantasy\nPoints
    Allowed to WRs.\n\n\nNew York Giants Passing Game vs Philadelphia Defense\n\nKerry
    Collins quietly finished with nice numbers last week.   He threw for\n338 yards
    and 1 TD.   Amani Toomer and Ike Hilliard saw lots of action with\nJoe Jurevicius
    seeing plenty of balls thrown his way too.   The Eagles have\ncooled lately where
    they rank # 16 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over\nthe last four weeks.   For
    the year, they rank # 2 in Fantasy Points Allowed\nto QBs and # 1 in Fantasy Points
    Allowed to WRs.   Their blitzing style can\ncause young QBs plenty of trouble
    but Collins' experience should help him.\n\n\nTennessee Passing Game vs Cleveland
    Defense\n\nSteve McNair played a gutsy game last week at well less than 100%.
    \  He\nmanaged 178 yards, 1 TD and 2 Interceptions.   Derrick Mason is still the\nprimary
    guy and saw more looks than TE Frank Wycheck which is saying\nsomething.   This
    week, they'll face a surprising Brown defense that ranks #\n10 in Passing Yards
    Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   For the\nyear, they rank # 3 in Fantasy
    Points Allowed to QBs and # 14 in Fantasy\nPoints Allowed to WRs.\n\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\n\nDefensive
    Slam Dunks:  These games feature a Defense that's been very strong\nlately.\n\n\nAtlanta
    Passing Game vs Miami Defense\n\nChris Chandler continued his up and down season
    with a monster game last\nweek throwing for 431 yards and 2 TDs against Buffalo.
    \  Terance Mathis,\nTony Martin and Footballguy Favorite Brian Finneran all had
    great games.\nAs you know though, these guys are very inconsistent.   This week,
    they'll\nface a Miami Defense that ranks # 1 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game
    over\nthe last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 6 in Fantasy Points Allowed\nto
    QBs and # 10 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.\n\n\nBaltimore Passing Game vs
    Tampa Bay Defense\n\nElvis Grbac continues to at least not hurt the offense.   He
    threw for 181\nyards last week with no TDs or Interceptions.   Qadry Ismail is
    the\npreferred target at WR with Shannon Sharpe always threatening to make an\nimpact.
    \  The Ravens face the Bucs who are hot right now ranking # 3 in\nPassing Yards
    Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year,\nthey rank # 11 in
    Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 9 in Fantasy Points\nAllowed to WRs.\n\n\nCincinnati
    Passing Game vs Pittsburgh Defense\n\nYou pretty much have to avoid all these
    guys.   Jon Kitna threw for 153\nyards and 3 Interceptions.   His most newsworthy
    accomplishment was a\nsideline shouting match with WR Chad Johnson.   Peter Warrick
    was benched\nfor fielding a punt on his own 3 yard line.   Warrick should start
    this\nweek.   They teased us early , but these are clearly still the Bengals.\nPittsburgh
    ranks # 5 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four\nweeks.   For the
    year, they rank # 7 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and #\n7 in Fantasy Points
    Allowed to WRs.\n\n\nSan Francisco Passing Game vs Dallas Defense\n\nGarcia only
    had 136 yards and 1 TD (although he was very close on another)\nbut he's still
    a must start in my book.   He's too good and has too many\nweapons.   Terrell
    Owens is of course a starter but J.J. Stokes or Tai\nStreets could be worth a
    look.   TE Eric Johnson is still very involved in\nthe passing game.   Dallas
    ranks # 2 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over\nthe last four weeks so they've
    been tough.   For the year, they rank # 4 in\nFantasy Points Allowed to QBs and
    # 3 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.\nTough matchups but I don't see how you
    can sit Garcia and Owens unless\nyou're just loaded.   See our cheatsheet rankings
    for exactly where we see\nthese guys ranked.\n\n\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\nBryant

    NOTE:   See the cheatsheet online www.footballguys.com for exactly\nwhere I rank
    players and to determine who to start.   I always receive\nemails asking me how
    I can have a guy ranked highly on the cheatsheet but\nlisted under a matchup that
    favors the Defense.   Just because one matchup\nmay be more favorable than another,
    that doesn't necessarily mean I'd start\nthe player with the best matchup.   Ahman
    Green may have a horrible matchup\none week but unless you're sitting on Ricky
    Williams or Marshall Faulk,\nGreen's your guy no matter who he's lining up against.

    \ These games feature Defenses that have struggled lately.\n\n\nArizona's Michael
    Pittman vs Carolina Defense\n\nAfter a few weeks of worrying about Thomas Jones,
    Michael Pittman seemed to\nclearly be the prime RB here last week.   He rushed
    14 times for 58 yards\n(4.1 ypc) plus a TD.   Thomas Jones, on the other hand,
    only had 4 carries\nfor 18 yards.   The Panthers rank # 30 in Rushing Yards Allowed
    per Game\nover the last four weeks so you have to like his chances again this
    week.\nFor the year, Carolina ranks # 30 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.\n\n\nAtlanta's
    Maurice Smith / Rodney Thomas vs Miami Defense\n\nProbably the strongest criticism
    of Smith you could offer is that he's\nlosing time to Rodney Thomas...   Smith
    was ineffective again last week but\ndid score the cheap TD.   He ran 14 times
    for 23 yards (1.6 ypc).   Thomas\nhad 41 yards on 13 carries (3.2 ypc) and did
    bring a spark.   Smith injured\nhis toe and even though it's not believed to be
    serious, it's hard to put\nmuch faith in him with Thomas coming on.   This week,
    they'll face a Dolphin\ndefense that's been soft lately ranking # 29 in Rushing
    Yards Allowed per\nGame over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank #
    17 in Fantasy\nPoints Allowed to RBs.   Make sure to understand, I don't have
    much faith in\neither of these guys so check the cheatsheets to see where I rank
    them.\nIt's just that the Dolphins have been very weak lately against the run.\n\n\nCarolina's
    Richard Huntley vs Arizona Defense\n\nHuntley ran pretty well last week against
    a tough St. Louis defense so it's\ntough to count him out.   He posted 74 yards
    on 19 carries (3.9 ypc) plus a\nscore.   This week, he gets a much softer defense
    in Arizona that Emmitt\nSmith ran over last week.   The Cardinals rank # 26 in
    Rushing Yards Allowed\nper Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they
    rank # 30 in Fantasy\nPoints Allowed to RBs.\n\n\nChicago's Anthony Thomas vs
    Detroit Defense\n\nThomas put in a very Bearish workmanlike effort last week with
    82 yards on\n24 carries (3.4 ypc)   Clearly, he's the kind of tough back this
    team wants\nyet he has the skills and speed to be more than just a grinder.   This
    week,\nhe'll likely see lots of action against the Lions ranked # 22 in Rushing\nYards
    Allowed per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank #\n26 in
    Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.\n\n\nGreen Bay's Ahman Green vs Minnesota Defense\n\nAhman
    Green bounced back as expected and proved why he's one of the league's\nelite
    backs.   He rolled up 150 yards on 21 carries (7.4 ypc).   He did have\na 43 yarder
    thrown in there.   He did leave with some breathing problems but\nhe is expected
    to be ok this week.   Watch to make sure, though.   This\nweek, he'll face a Viking
    team that looks like they've rolled over.   The\nVikings rank # 31 in Rushing
    Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks\nand # 31 in Fantasy Points Allowed
    to RBs.   It doesn't always play out in\nreal life, but on paper, it doesn't get
    much better than this.\n\n\nMiami's Lamar Smith vs Atlanta Defense\n\nAgain, Lamar
    Smith was weak.   12 rushes for 33 yards (2.8 ypc) and a big\nfumble.   But the
    Dolphins don't seem too excited about going with anyone\nelse so there's always
    that chance for a cheap TD, sort of like with\nAtlanta's Maurice Smith.   I don't
    have much faith in him but this week,\nhe'll face the soft Falcon defense that's
    ranked # 28 in Rushing Yards\nAllowed per Game over the last four weeks and let
    the Bills run wild on them\nlast week.   For the year, they rank # 28 in Fantasy
    Points Allowed to RBs\nso you have to like the matchup.   Check the cheatsheets
    to see exactly\nwhere we rank him.\n\nNew York Jet's Curtis Martin vs Buffalo
    Defense\n\nMartin put in his typical workhorse effort Sunday with 122 yards on
    23\ncarries (5.3 ypc)   Look for more of the same against the Bills ranked # 23\nin
    Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year,\nthey
    rank # 25 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.\n\n\nSt. Louis' Marshall Faulk vs
    Indianapolis Defense\n\nYawn.   Start Faulk.   He rolled up 202 yards on 30 carries
    last week (6.7\nypc)   Best player in the game yada yada.   He's the man.   If
    it matters to\nyou (and it shouldn't) the Colts rank # 27 in Rushing Yards Allowed
    per Game\nover the last four weeks and # 29 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.\n\n\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\n\nPrime
    Matchups:  These games feature Defenses that haven't been strong\nlately.\n\n\nDenver's
    Terrell Davis vs Oakland Defense\n\nTerrell Davis jumps back in the fray after
    a week of rest.   Oakland's\ndefense has improved from awful to just bad over
    the last few weeks.   They\nrank # 24 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the
    last four weeks.   For\nthe year, they rank # 21 in Fantasy Points Allowed to
    RBs.   Oakland allowed\nTennessee's Skip Hicks and Eddie George to run for 87
    yards last week so\nthey are getting better.\n\n\nJacksonville's Stacey Mack vs
    Kansas City Defense\n\nWe caught a little flak last week for listing Stacey Mack
    in the lock column\nagainst the Raiders but Mack helped us out with another 100+
    yard day.   He\nrushed 27 times for 111 yards (4.1 ypc) plus 2 TDs.   Of course,
    just to\nmake you Mack owners nervous, Coach Tom Coughlin said this week that
    Fred\nTaylor could see action this week or next...\nhttp://www.jacksonville.com/tu-online/stories/122501/jag_8179728.html
    \  I\npersonally don't see it this week but with this season, you never know.\nKansas
    City ranks # 19 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four\nweeks.   For
    the year, they rank # 23 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.\n\n\nNew Orleans' Ricky
    Williams vs Washington Defense\n\nWilliams owners (like me) groaned when the Saints
    fell behind so early last\nweek.   Williams was effectively taken out of the game.
    \  Although\ntruthfully, he's been less and less a factor lately regardless of
    the score.\nHe ran for 26 yards on 10 carries (2.6 ypc) and caught 4 passes for
    15\nyards.   That's pretty small.   This week, he'll face the Redskins who rank\n#
    20 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks.   For the\nyear,
    they rank # 24 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.\n\n\nTennessee's Eddie George
    vs Cleveland Defense\n\nAs weird as it sounds, Eddie George will get the carries
    this week by\ndefault as Skip Hicks injured his hamstring and won't see action.
    \  The\nBrowns rank # 25 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four
    weeks\nand for the year, they rank # 20 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.\n\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\n\nEven
    Matchups:  These games feature no real advantage either way\n\n\nBaltimore's Terry
    Allen vs Tampa Bay Defense\n\nAllen looked solid last week with 91 yards on 22
    carries (4.1 ypc) plus a\nscore.   He showed little ill effects of being off and
    actually may have\nbenefited from the rest.   This week, he'll face a resurging
    Buc defense\nthat's ranked # 13 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last
    four\nweeks.   That's up from # 21 last week.   For the year, they rank # 10 in\nFantasy
    Points Allowed to RBs.\n\n\nBuffalo's Shawn Bryson vs New York Jets Defense\n\nAs
    you know, Bryson went wild last week rushing for 130 yards on 16 carries\n(8.1
    ypc) plus 2 scores.   He also tacked on 31 yards on 3 receptions.\nBryson did
    have a 68 yard run which padded the stats a little but they all\ncount.   Henry
    will likely sit again giving Bryson another start.   The Jets\nrank # 18 in Rushing
    Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks.   For\nthe year, they rank #
    27 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.\n\n\nNew York Giant's Tiki Barber / Ron Dayne
    vs Philadelphia Defense\n\nNeither RB saw much action last week with Barber rushing
    12 times for 47\nyards (3.9 ypc) and Dayne only rushing 7 times for 42 yards (6.0
    ypc) and a\nscore.   Barber of course, is more active in the passing game.   This
    week,\nthey'll face an Eagle defense ranked # 15 in Rushing Yards Allowed per
    Game\nover the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 9 in Fantasy Points\nAllowed
    to RBs.\n\n\nSan Diego's LaDainian Tomlinson vs Seattle Defense\n\nSo much for
    that rookie \"wall\".   Tomlinson rushed 27 times for 145 yards\n(5.4 ypc) last
    week.   Clearly, he's the primary focus of the offense.   San\nDiego has a bye
    in week 17 (that's not really fair is it?) so this is the\nlast game.   Drew Brees
    could see some action which probably means Tomlinson\nwill be even more the focus
    if that's possible.   The Seahawks rank # 17 in\nRushing Yards Allowed per Game
    over the last four weeks.   For the year,\nthey rank # 14 in Fantasy Points Allowed
    to RBs.\n\n\nSan Francisco's Garrison Hearst / Kevan Barlow vs Dallas Defense\n\nHearst
    had a solid but not great game last week with 72 yards on 17 carries\n(4.2 ypc)
    \  Kevan Barlow carried the ball 6 times for 25 yards (4.2 ypc)\nBarlow also caught
    3 passes.   He's creeping into Hearst's time.   This\nweek, they'll face a Cowboy
    Defense ranked # 16 in Rushing Yards Allowed per\nGame over the last four weeks.
    \  For the year, they rank # 13 in Fantasy\nPoints Allowed to RBs.\n\n\nTampa
    Bay's Mike Alstott / Warrick Dunn vs Baltimore Defense\n\nIt's tough to predict
    too much with these guys but Mike Alstott was clearly\nthe featured RB last week
    rushing for 101 yards on 24 carries (4.2 ypc) with\na score.   Warrick Dunn had
    10 rushes for 32 yards (3.2 ypc) and added 46\nyards receiving plus a TD.   This
    week, they'll face a Baltimore defense\nthat's bark is worse than it's bite lately.
    \  They rank # 21 in Rushing\nYards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks.
    \  For the year, they rank #\n2 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.   That just
    means that lately, they've\ngiven up a lot of yards.   The Tampa backs have been
    very up and down so be\nleery.\n\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\n\nDownside
    Matchups:  These games feature a Defense that's been pretty strong\nlately.\n\n\nCleveland's
    Jamel White vs Tennessee Defense\n\nJamel White prompted lots of \"where's he
    been?\" comments from the Brown\nfaithful last week as he rolled up 131 yards
    on 21 carries (6.2 ypc)   With\nJames Jackson out and Ben Gay still too unreliable,
    it looks like the Browns\nwill continue to utilize White.   He'll face a tough
    Defense this week in\nTennessee that ranks # 5 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game
    over the last\nfour weeks.   For the year, they rank # 15 in Fantasy Points Allowed
    to RBs.\n\n\nDallas' Emmitt Smith vs San Francisco Defense\n\nSmith is probably
    happy as he got a chance to pad his stats last week with\n128 yards on 26 carries
    (4.9 ypc)   He ran pretty well after a slow start\nand being totally and repeatedly
    shut down at the goalline.   He's clearly\njust an average to below average back
    at this point in his career.   He does\nlook like he'll be able to hold off Troy
    Hambrick though.   The 49ers rank #\n3 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over
    the last four weeks.   For the\nyear, they rank # 18 in Fantasy Points Allowed
    to RBs.   Don't discount the\nfact Smith is going for another 1,000 yard season.
    \  Of course, with Quincy\nCarter at QB, I'd give it to Emmitt too.\n\n\nDetroit's
    Lamont Warren / James Stewart vs Chicago Defense\n\nJames Stewart re-injured his
    troublesome ankle last week and Lamont Warren\ncame in and played well rushing
    9 times for 48 yards (5.3 ypc) against a\nsuper tough Pittsburgh team.   (Although
    he did get 34 of those yards on one\nrun)   The going isn't much easier this week
    against the Bears who rank # 9\nin Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last
    four weeks and # 11 in\nFantasy Points Allowed to RBs.   Keep an eye out this
    week to see whether\nStewart or Warren will play.\n\n\nIndianapolis' Dominic Rhodes
    vs St. Louis Defense\n\nRhodes put together another excellent game last week against
    the Jets with\n126 yards on 17 carries (7.4 ypc) with 1 score.   He also tacked
    on 26 yards\non 3 receptions.   He did have 2 fumbles though.   This week, he'll
    face a\ntough Ram defense ranked # 8 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the
    last\nfour weeks.   For the year, they rank # 5 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.\nAlthough
    it should be noted they let Carolina's Richard Huntley run for 74\nyards and a
    TD on them last week so it's not like they're invincible.\n\n\nMinnesota's Michael
    Bennett vs Green Bay Defense\n\nBennett suffered last week from the same problem
    he's had most of the year.\nHe just didn't get enough carries to make a difference.
    \  Although one could\nargue that after producing just 17 yards on the 11 carries
    he was given (1.5\nypc), he didn't deserve any more.   Bennett's a percentage
    guy that'll be\nshut down for a while and then eventually break one long.   It's
    just that\nmost teams can't afford to wait as long it seems to be taking Bennett
    to get\ngoing.   This week, he'll face a Packer team ranked # 14 in Rushing Yards\nAllowed
    per Game over the last four weeks.   For the season, they rank # 16\nin Fantasy
    Points Allowed to RBs.\n\n\nPhiladelphia's Duce Staley vs New York Giants Defense\n\nDuce
    Staley has apparently forgotten how to run the ball lately but it\ndoesn't matter
    as he's clearly the Eagles #1 receiver.   Last week, he\nrushed 15 times for 35
    yards (2.3 ypc)   But he caught 9 passes for 103\nyards.   This week, he'll face
    the Giants who rank # 10 in Rushing Yards\nAllowed per Game over the last four
    weeks.   More importantly for Staley,\nthey rank # 6 in Passing Yards Allowed
    Per Game over the last four weeks.\nFor the year, they rank # 3 in Fantasy Points
    Allowed to RBs.\n\n\nPittsburgh's Jerome Bettis / Chris Fuamatu-Ma'afala vs Cincinnati
    Defense\n\nCoach Cowher has upgraded Bettis to Questionable for this week and
    says\nhe'll play if he's healthy.   Tough to say who'll get the call but one has\nto
    think that if he plays, Bettis will be used just enough to keep him\nfresh.   The
    Steelers are winning without him, have a very beatable opponent\nin Cincinnati
    this week, and don't want to jeopardize their playoff\nsituation where they know
    they'll need Bettis.   Plus, the Bengals rush\nDefense is tougher than many think.
    \  They rank # 12 in Rushing Yards\nAllowed per Game over the last four weeks.
    \  For the year, they rank # 7 in\nFantasy Points Allowed to RBs.\n\n\nSeattle's
    Shaun Alexander vs San Diego Defense\n\nAlexander looked to be making a statement
    that he should have been the guy\nall along with 96 yards on 28 carries (3.4 ypc)
    and a score plus another 36\nyards receiving with a TD.   He'll face the Chargers
    this week that rank #\n11 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four
    weeks.   For the\nyear, they rank # 6 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.\n\n\nWashington's
    Stephen Davis vs New Orleans Defense\n\nDavis was held pretty much in check against
    the Bears last week with 57\nyards on 22 carries (2.6 ypc)   He did get the score
    though.   He's clearly\nthe prime weapon here.   How much would YOU depend on
    Tony Banks?   This\nweek, he faces a Saints defense that's been tough lately ranking
    # 4 in\nRushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year,\nthey
    rank # 19 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.\n\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\n\nDefensive
    Slam Dunks:  These games feature a Defense that's been very strong\nlately.\n\n\nCincinnati's
    Corey Dillon vs Pittsburgh Defense\n\nDillon ran well against the overhyped Raven
    rush defense.   As the numbers\nshowed in the week 15 matchup info, Baltimore's
    been nothing special against\nthe run lately.   They were ranked # 12 last week
    for Dillon and this week,\nthey rank # 21 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over
    the last four weeks.\nSometimes the numbers tell you more than the reputation.
    \  This week though,\nthe Steelers rep is backed up with the numbers.   Pittsburgh
    ranks # 2 in\nRushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks.   For the
    year,\nthey rank # 1 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.   This is a MUCH tougher\nmatchup
    than last week against the Ravens.\n\n\nKansas City's Priest Holmes / Tony Richardson
    vs Jacksonville Defense\n\nHolmes had a on \"off\" day for him with \"only\" 80
    yards on 23 carries (3.5)\nand 12 yards receiving.   He'll be fine.   Tony Richardson
    stole another\ncheap TD.   Richardson's a gamble as he won't likely get many yards
    even on\na good day but he's a threat for a short TD.   The Jaguars have been
    tough\nlately ranking # 1 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four\nweeks.
    \  For the year, they rank # 8 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.   I'd\nstill
    consider Holmes a must start in most leagues, but this is a tough\nmatchup.\n\nOakland's
    Charlie Garner / Tyrone Wheatley / Zack Crockett vs Denver Defense\n\nCharlie
    Garner ran well when he ran but as has often been the case lately,\nhe didn't
    run enough.  He had 54 yards on just 10 carries (5.4 ypc)   And\nmost of those
    were between the 20's.   Zack Crockett and Tyrone Wheatley\nboth saw action making
    it nearly impossible to pick which one will do\nanything.   The Broncos rank #
    6 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the\nlast four weeks.   For the year,
    they rank # 4 in Fantasy Points Allowed to\nRBs so it'll be a touch matchup.\n\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\n\nThat'll
    do it for the Rushing Matchups.   Passing Matchups to follow.\n\nJoe\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\nBryant

    GRIDIRON GURU\n\nWelcome to Gridiron Guru, where we'll answer your questions \nabout
    players and offer Fantasy Football roster advice. We \ninvite you to send your
    own scouting reports and comments on \nplayers to: gridguru@commissioner.com.
    You'll get the chance \nto be heard by thousands of Fantasy players just like
    \nyourself! \n\nMatt Biggins, Los Angeles, CA: Which two receivers should I \nstart
    this weekend: Todd Pinkston, Bill Schroeder, Chris \nCarter, Terry Glenn or James
    McKnight? Who would you \nrecommend starting out of Duce Staley, Stephen Davis,
    Ron \nDayne, Kevan Barlow and Jason Brookins?\n\nG.G. - As long as Schroeder (ankle)
    is healthy, he's a must-\nstart against a Minnesota defense that allowed Charlie
    Batch \nto throw for 345 yards and three touchdowns last weekend. \nMiami has
    a bye, so McKnight is obviously not an option. \nPinkston and Glenn both have
    good matchups, but we'd have to \ngo with Carter in this case. This season has
    been very \nunpredictable, so going with your most established player in \nthis
    case is the best move. To answer your second question, \nwe'd recommend Davis
    against a vulnerable Carolina defense \nand Dayne against Philadelphia. It's tough
    to choose Davis, \nbut Barlow has a bye and both Staley and Brookins will be \nsplitting
    carries at best, so our hands are tied. \n\nJeff Smith, Tampa, FL: I have Jeff
    Garcia, who has a bye \nthis week. I have the option of starting Jim Miller or
    \npicking up Chris Weinke. What do you recommend?\n\nG.G. - Miller has been very
    inconsistent from a Fantasy \nperspective, so we'd have to side with Weinke. He'll
    be \nfacing a Washington defense decimated by injuries and \nvulnerable to players
    like Muhsin Muhammad, Donald Hayes \nand Wesley Walls. Weinke could have a big
    game.\n\nScott Buzby, Newark, DE: Who should I start this week: \nShannon Sharpe
    or Bubba Franks?  Also, is it time to drop \nJames Thrash? Kevin Johnson, Laveranues
    Coles, Todd Pinkston \nand Joe Jurevicius are all still available.\n\nG.G. - Franks
    has been Brett Favre's favorite target in the \nred zone, but Sharpe is one of
    the best tight ends in the \nleague. Sharpe will always give you good production
    from the \ntight end spot, and we highly doubt that Franks will be able \nto continue
    to score touchdowns at his current pace of one \nper game. As far as Thrash goes,
    we feel he's just not good \nenough to be facing No.1 cornerbacks on a weekly
    basis, so \nhis numbers will be inconsistent at best. Your best bet is \nto drop
    him and go after another No. 1-caliber wideout like \nJohnson, who could emerge
    as a reliable Fantasy player. \n\n\nMVP.com\n\nStay warm this postseason with

    OF THE WEEK\n\nPhil Brown, St. Louis, MO: When will people start giving \nPriest
    Holmes the credit he deserves? He is the best \noffensive option the Chiefs have,
    and he even has more \nrushing yards than Marshall Faulk after five weeks. With
    \nDick Vermeil calling the shots in Kansas City, Holmes will \ncontinue to be
    a productive player all season. \n\n\nSPORTING NEWS\n\nSubscribe to The Sporting

    of <b>Duce Staley, Stephen Davis, Ron\nDayne, Kevan Barlow</b> and <b>Jason Brookins</b>?\n\n</font></p><b><font

    - GG\n</font></b><p><p><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"> \n<!-- Q1 answer --> \nAs
    long as Schroeder (ankle) is healthy, he's a must-\nstart against a Minnesota
    defense that allowed <b>Charlie Batch</b>\nto throw for 345 yards and three touchdowns
    last weekend.\nMiami has a bye, so McKnight is obviously not an option.\nPinkston
    and Glenn both have good matchups, but we'd have to\ngo with Carter in this case.
    This season has been very\nunpredictable, so going with your most established
    player in\nthis case is the best move. To answer your second question,\nwe'd recommend
    Davis against a vulnerable Carolina defense\nand Dayne against Philadelphia. It's
    tough to choose Davis,\nbut Barlow has a bye and both Staley and Brookins will
    be\nsplitting carries at best, so our hands are tied.\n</p></font></td> \n</tr>

    Sharpe will always give you good production from the\ntight end spot, and we highly

  body: ! "/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\nWall of Champs Is Up!
    \  If you've made your playoffs or won your league, let\nthe world know about
    it.   We've got our Wall of Champs up and running and\nwaiting for you.   Check
    it out here  http://footballguys.com/wall2001.cfm\nYou can add your team here
    http://footballguys.com/addwall.cfm   There's not\nmuch better than flaunting
    your success in front of your league members...\nEnjoy.\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\nHi
    Folks,\n\nDoing our best to get these to you early in the week as you juggle your\nlineups
    for this final week 17.   Here's how I see the Rushing Game Matchups\nthis week.\n\nPLEASE
    NOTE:   See the cheatsheet online www.footballguys.com for exactly\nwhere I rank
    players and to determine who to start.   I always receive\nemails asking me how
    I can have a guy ranked highly on the cheatsheet but\nlisted under a matchup that
    favors the Defense.   Just because one matchup\nmay be more favorable than another,
    that doesn't necessarily mean I'd start\nthe player with the best matchup.   Ahman
    Green may have a horrible matchup\none week but unless you're sitting on Ricky
    Williams or Marshall Faulk,\nGreen's your guy no matter who he's lining up against.
    \ (Yes, even after\nlast week's performance)  The matchup info is meant to be
    just one more tool\nin your box when it comes to deciding between players.\n\nStats
    are provided by Mike Hall's excellent FLM League Management Software.\nhttp://www.fflm.com/
    for more info.   Fantasy Points Allowed by position\nnumbers are from ESPN.com.
    \  Target numbers are from our Footballguy Andy\nHicks.\nLet's get to it.\n\nJoe\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\n\n\nLocks:
    \ These games feature Defenses that have struggled lately.\n\n\nBaltimore's Terry
    Allen vs Minnesota Defense\n\nTerry Allen ran hard last week where he rushed 20
    times for 74 yards (3.3\nypc) against a tough Buc team.   It'll be much easier
    this week against the\nswiss cheese Vikings ranked # 30 in Rushing Yards Allowed
    per Game over the\nlast 4 weeks.   Although, these Vikings did shut down Ahman
    Green last week.\nFor the year, they rank # 31 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.\n\n\nDenver's
    Terrell Davis vs Indianapolis Defense\n\nTerrell Davis looked good again rushing
    for 89 yards on 18 carries (4.9 ypc)\nIt's been a tough year and you can bet he'll
    want to finish strong.   The\nColts rank # 23 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game
    over the last 4 weeks.\nFor the year, they rank # 29 in Fantasy Points Allowed
    to RBs.\n\n\nNew England's Antowain Smith vs Carolina Defense\n\nA rested Antowain
    Smith faces the soft Carolina defense that's ranked # 31\nin Rushing Yards Allowed
    per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year,\nthey rank # 20 in Fantasy Points
    Allowed to RBs.   Great matchup.\n\n\nPittsburgh's Chris Fuamatu-Ma'afala / Jerome
    Bettis vs Cleveland Defense\n\nFuamatu-Ma'afala was a workhorse on the ground
    Sunday but didn't have a lot\nto show for it.   He ran 25 times for 55 yards (2.2
    ypc)   He did score on a\nreceiving TD.   He'll face a weak Cleveland defense
    ranked # 29 in Rushing\nYards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the
    year, they rank # 20\nin Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.\n\n\nWashington's Stephen
    Davis vs Arizona Defense\n\nStephen Davis looked great rushing for 111 yards on
    21 carries (5.3 ypc) and\nthe score.   He left with a knee tweak but it doesn't
    look to be serious.\nKi-Jana Carter played great after Davis left.   The Cardinals
    rank # 21 in\nRushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the
    year, they\nrank # 22 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.\n\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\n\nPrime
    Matchups:  These games feature Defenses that haven't been strong\nlately.\n\n\nBuffalo's
    Shawn Bryson / Travis Henry / Sammy Morris vs Miami Defense\n\nBryson ran wild
    again rushing 28 times for 107 yards (3.8 ypc).   Sammy\nMorris spelled him for
    a few carries and looked good too but it seems Bryson\nis clearly the man here.
    \  It's possible Henry could see action so keep an\neye on this one through the
    week.   The Dolphins have fallen down to # 28 in\nRushing Yards Allowed per Game
    over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they\nrank # 17 in Fantasy Points Allowed
    to RBs.\n\n\nDallas' Emmitt Smith vs Detroit Defense\n\nEmmitt looked very solid
    again rushing for 126 yards on 26 carries (4.8 ypc)\nalthough he failed to score.
    \  He needs a little over 60 yards to get 1,000\nfor the season so you can bet
    he'll be gunning for that.   The Lions rank #\n18 in Rushing Yards Allowed per
    Game over the last 4 weeks and # 24 in\nFantasy Points Allowed to RBs.\n\n\nNew
    York Giants' Tiki Barber / Ron Dayne vs Green Bay Defense\n\nBarber saw more action
    with 16 carries and 71 yards (4.4 ypc) but it was\nDayne who scored with 59 yards
    on 8 carries (7.4 ypc)   Barber was very\nactive again in the passing game.   The
    Packers let Michael Bennett run well\nSunday and have slipped to # 27 in Rushing
    Yards Allowed per Game over the\nlast 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 13
    in Fantasy Points Allowed to\nRBs.\n\n\nNew York Jet's Curtis Martin vs Oakland
    Defense\n\nMartin put in another Martin Like day with 115 yards on 19 carries
    (6.1 ypc)\nThe Jets may have problems, but Martin isn't one.   He'll face an Oakland\ndefense
    ranked # 19 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks.\nFor the
    year, they rank # 21 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.\n\n\nOakland's Charlie
    Garner vs New York Jets Defense\n\nThe Raiders don't look nearly as strong as
    they did.   Garner only had 9\ncarries Sunday for 23 yards (2.6 ypc)   Tyrone
    Wheatley only had 5 carries.\nThis week they've got a nice matchup as they'll
    face the Jets ranked # 26 in\nRushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks.
    \  For the year, they\nrank # 27 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.\n\n\nSeattle's
    Shaun Alexander vs Kansas City Defense\n\nAlexander didn't do much Sunday rushing
    23 times for 59 yards (2.6 ypc)   He\n'll be ok though and gets to face a Chief
    defense ranked # 22 in Rushing\nYards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks.
    \  For the year, they rank # 23\nin Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.\n\n\nSt. Louis'
    Marshall Faulk vs Atlanta Defense\n\nStart Faulk.   The question will be of course
    how much he plays but it was\npretty obvious Sunday that Mike Martz lets his guys
    play.   Trung Canidate\ncould have really used the work but he warmed the bench
    while Faulk went\nnuts.   I'd say you'll get at least a half, maybe much more
    out of Faulk and\nhalf of Faulk is worth more than most backs.   The Falcons rank
    # 24 in\nRushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks and # 28 in Fantasy\nPoints
    Allowed to RBs.\n\n\n\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\n\nEven
    Matchups:  These games feature no real advantage either way\n\n\nArizona's Michael
    Pittman vs Washington Defense\n\nJust when it looked like Michael Pittman was
    going to take over the clear\ncut # 1 RB role, Thomas Jones steps in with 16 carries.
    \  Pittman rushed 12\ntimes for 89 yards (7.4 ypc) which was bolstered by a 39
    yarder.   Jones ran\nfor 69 yards on 16 carries (4.3 ypc)   This was Carolina,
    though.   This\nweek will feature a tougher test with Washington ranked # 8 in
    Rushing Yards\nAllowed per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they've
    been pretty\nsoft though and rank # 25 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.\n\n\nKansas
    City's Priest Holmes / Tony Richardson vs Seattle Defense\n\nPriest Holmes ran
    27 times for 91 yards (3.4 ypc) plus the score.   Tony\nRichardson didn't have
    a carry.   This week, he'll face the Seahawks ranked\n# 12 in Rushing Yards Allowed
    per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the\nyear, they rank # 14 in Fantasy Points
    Allowed to RBs.\n\n\nMiami's Lamar Smith / Travis Minor vs Buffalo Defense\n\nThis
    is getting embarrassing.   Smith rushed 7 times for 4 yards (0.6 ypc)\nTravis
    Minor had 33 yards on 9 carries (3.7 ypc)   He's becoming less and\nless of a
    factor with each game.   The Dolphins are in the playoffs but find\nthemselves
    playing a different style of ball than they have been.   Minor's\na threat to
    go long on the screen passes and Smith is a long shot for a\ncheap TD.   They'll
    face the Bills ranked # 13 in Rushing Yards Allowed per\nGame over the last 4
    weeks and # 26 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.\n\n\nMinnesota's Michael Bennett
    vs Baltimore Defense\n\nWe said Bennett just needed carries and he got them Sunday
    rushing 25 times\nfor 104 yards (4.2 ypc)   He'll face a Baltimore defense that's
    numbers don'\nt back up it's reputation this week - they rank # 25 in Rushing
    Yards\nAllowed per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 2 in\nFantasy
    Points Allowed to RBs.\n\n\nNew Orleans' Ricky Williams vs San Francisco Defense\n\nEven
    though he didn't score, it was a better performance by Williams who\nrushed 17
    times for 74 yards (4.4 ypc)   The Saints clearly want him to be\nmore involved
    as he was Sunday.   This week, he'll face a 49er defense\nranked # 17 in Rushing
    Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks and # 18\nin Fantasy Points Allowed
    to RBs.\n\n\nSan Francisco's Garrison Hearst vs New Orleans Defense\n\nGarrison
    Hearst was a non factor Sunday with just 35 yards on 11 carries\n(3.2 ypc)   Kevan
    Barlow didn't do much either so it wasn't like he lost\ntime to another player.
    \  This week, he gets the Saints who rank # 15 in\nRushing Yards Allowed per Game
    over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they\nrank # 19 in Fantasy Points Allowed
    to RBs.\n\n\nTampa Bay's Warrick Dunn / Mike Alstott vs Philadelphia Defense\n\nTampa's
    One-Two punch continues to work.   Alstott had 80 yards on 14\ncarries (5.7 ypc)
    and Dunn carried the ball 13 times for 47 yards (3.6 ypc)\nAlstott's been more
    effective on the ground but Dunn seems to be more\ninvolved in the passing game.
    \  This week, they'll face an Eagle defense\nranked # 20 in Rushing Yards Allowed
    per Game over the last 4 weeks and # 9\nin Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.\n\n\n\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\n\nDownside
    Matchups:  These games feature a Defense that's been pretty strong\nlately.\n\n\nCincinnati's
    Corey Dillon vs Tennessee Defense\n\nDillon showed again he can run on any defense.
    \  He had 91 yards on 21\ncarries (4.3 ypc) against the Steelers.   He'll face
    the Titans this week\nranked # 6 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last
    4 weeks so it won\n't get much easier.   They rank # 15 in Fantasy Points Allowed
    to RBs.\n\n\nDetroit's Lamont Warren / James Stewart vs Dallas Defense\n\nThe
    Detroit RBs were horrible on the ground in this one with Lamont Warren\ngaining
    19 yards on 6 carries (3.2 ypc).   Cory Schlesinger did catch 11\npasses though
    so maybe he's worth a longshot pick there.   The Cowboys rank\n# 14 in Rushing
    Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks and # 12 in\nFantasy Points Allowed
    to RBs.\n\n\nGreen Bay's Ahman Green vs New York Giants Defense\n\nGreen was shut
    down on the ground with just 31 yards on 16 carries (1.9 ypc)\nalthough he did
    score.   Go figure.   He's still too good to sit in my\nopinion.   This week,
    he'll face the Giants ranked # 10 in Rushing Yards\nAllowed per Game over the
    last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 3 in\nFantasy Points Allowed to RBs
    so it's a tough matchup, although I think I'd\nstart Green unless you really have
    a solid alternative.\n\n\nIndianapolis' Dominic Rhodes vs Denver Defense\n\nAgain,
    Dominic Rhodes looked excellent rushing for 83 yards on 20 carries\n(4.2 ypc)
    with a score.   He'll face the Broncos this week ranked # 7 in\nRushing Yards
    Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they\nrank # 4 in Fantasy
    Points Allowed to RBs.   The Broncos are definitely\nsurging after the win in
    Oakland but I still like Rhodes.\n\n\nJacksonville's Stacey Mack vs Chicago Defense\n\nMack
    went off last week with 125 yards on 16 carries (7.8 ypc) and a score.\nIt'll
    be tougher this week against Chicago that ranks # 9 in Rushing Yards\nAllowed
    per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 10 in\nFantasy Points
    Allowed to RBs.\n\n\nPhiladelphia's Duce Staley vs Tampa Bay Defense\n\nStaley's
    receiving numbers had been carrying him lately and this week he\npaid the price.
    \  He only rushed 8 times for 23 yards (2.9 ypc) and was shut\n down receiving
    with just 2 receptions for -1 yards.   This week, he'll face\na surging Buc defense
    ranked # 16 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the\nlast 4 weeks and # 11
    in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.\n\n\nTennessee's Eddie George vs Cincinnati
    Defense\n\nEddie George looked the old Eddie Sunday with 130 yards on 26 carries
    (5.0\nypc)   Plus 2 scores.  This week he'll face a Bengal defense ranked # 11
    in\nRushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they\nrank
    # 7 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.\n\n\n\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\n\nDefensive
    Slam Dunks:  These games feature a Defense that's been very strong\nlately.\n\n\nAtlanta's
    Maurice Smith vs St. Louis Defense\n\nAgain, Maurice Smith ran poorly but got
    a cheap TD.   He managed just 38\nyards on 15 carries (2.5 ypc).   Bob Christian
    stole 10 carries where he\ngained 33 yards (3.3 ypc)   They're both a gamble against
    a tough Ram\ndefense ranked # 3 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last
    4 weeks.\nFor the year, they rank # 5 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.\n\n\nCarolina's
    Richard Huntley vs New England Defense\n\nHuntley ran pretty well last week gaining
    62 yards on 12 carries (5.2 ypc).\nHe just didn't get enough carries for this
    awful Carolina team.   That won't\nget any better this week agains the Patriots
    ranked # 2 in Rushing Yards\nAllowed per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the
    year, they rank # 16 in\nFantasy Points Allowed to RBs.\n\n\nChicago's Anthony
    Thomas vs Jacksonville Defense\n\nThomas ran 25 times for 76 yards (3.0 ypc) Sunday.
    \  He'll face a tougher\ndefense in Jacksonville that's been awesome lately ranking
    # 1 in Rushing\nYards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year,
    they rank # 8\nin Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.   Thomas is still probably a
    starter in\nmost leagues, but the Jaguars have been extremely stingy of late.\n\n\nCleveland's
    Jamel White vs Pittsburgh Defense\n\nWhite only had 42 yards on 21 carries (2.0
    ypc) but did score twice.   Corey\nDillon showed the Steeler defense wasn't perfect
    last week.  They're still\ntough though ranked # 4 in Rushing Yards Allowed per
    Game over the last 4\nweeks.   For the year, they rank # 1 in Fantasy Points Allowed
    to RBs.\n\n\n\n\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\n\nThat'll

  subject: ! '[Footballguys] Update - Todd Bouman to Start'
  body: ! "Clipped from the article from Kevin Seifert, Star Tribune\n\nentire article:
    \ http://www.startribune.com/stories/510/915564.html\n\nVikings quarterback Todd
    Bouman, declaring that the injured thumb on \nhis throwing hand is much better,
    said today he's ready to go Sunday \nagainst the Jacksonville Jaguars.\n\n\"I
    took all of the snaps today,'' said Bouman, who has moved up to \nstartiang quarterback
    after Daunte Culpepper injured his knee. \"The \nthumb is a little sore, but I'll
    be ready to go on Sunday.\"\n\nBouman continued: \"I've come a long way the last
    couple of days. With \nall of the treatment I have gotten, I can squeeze the ball
    and I can \nthrow pretty much anything I want to throw, so I don't foresee it
    \nbeing a problem.\"\n\nThe St. Cloud State product injured his thumb in the team's
    27-24 \nloss last Sunday to Detroit. \n\nBouman has had limited practice action
    this week. Backup Spurgeon \nWynn has taken more snaps the past few days, and
    the team brought in \nRamaro Miller, cut in training camp, should he have been
    needed to \nback up Wynn.\n\nBouman today called dealing with the injury just
    \"part of the game. \nYou've just got to come in and get treatment, and hopefully
    things \nwill turn around fast. It's progressed each day, and that's all you \ncan
    do.\"\n\nHe said there's a risk that it could be re-injured Sunday. \"It's not
    \ngoing to heal until the season is over. So any time if you get hit on \nit,
    it's going to re-injure it or aggravate it. But you've just got \nto deal with
    it.\"\n\nConcerning Culpepper's surgery, Green said today that it \"went as \nexpected
    ... and he has a positive prognosis. Daunte's rehabilitation \nwill begin immediately.\"\n\nWhile
    there's be no definitive word on when Culpepper might return to \nthe lineup,
    he could end up missing the season's remaining three \ngames. The consequence
    of that appears minimal, considering the \nVikings are virtually eliminated from
    a playoff berth.\n\n****************************\n\nOur View:  With Todd taking
    all the snaps on Thursday, he is a very \nsafe bet to start on Sunday.  Culpepper
    is not expected to return \nthis season so Todd should start the remainder of
    the season unless \nhe is injured further.\n\n\nTo unsubscribe from this group,

    called Last-Minute Getaways. Unlike\nInternet-only specials, we give you many
    days to travel and more options\nfor less. Instead of being locked into a Saturday
    departure and returning\nthe following Monday or Tuesday, we give you many more
    choices. You can\ndepart Thursday, Friday or Saturday and return on Sunday, Monday
    or\nTuesday, depending on the inventory of cheap seats. Plus, to help you save\neven
    more money, we have negotiated a special rental car rate or special\nhotel rate
    to go with the airfare. What is great about this offer is that\nyou may be flying
    and staying at a major hotel cheaper than the lowest\npublished airfare alone.
    This is a very exciting new program for our\nvisitors and our Bestfares.com members.
    Our members can receive an\nadditional $30 off any of the airfare/hotel or airfare/car
    programs based\non two people traveling together, giving you an unbelievable travel
    deal.\nAs an added benefit, you can take off in as little as three hours. This
    is\na great offer if you are trying to get out of town in the next two weeks\nwith
    little notice. Be sure to review these fares if you have a\nlast-minute emergency,
    it could save you more than $1,000 over\ncompassionate and bereavement fares.

  subject: ! '[Footballguys] Breaking News - Correll Buckhalter Trouble'
  body: ! "Entire story:  http://espn.go.com/nfl/news/2001/1117/1279805.html\n\n\nLeading
    rusher Correll Buckhalter is among three rookie players suspended\nfor one game
    by Philadelphia Eagles head coach Andy Reid on Saturday after a\nFriday night
    incident in which the trio was taken into custody on possible\ndrug charges.\n\nNone
    of the players will participate in Sunday's game at Dallas, nor will\nthey be
    allowed to even make the trip, as the result of the team action.\n\nESPN.com has
    learned that safety Terrence Carroll, an undrafted free agent\nfrom Oregon State,
    is the only one of the players who will be charged. The\nplayers were stopped
    Friday night as they drove on South Street, a trendy\narea of shops and clubs,
    and police detected an odor of marijuana.\n\nCarroll is expected to be charged
    with marijuana possession and he remains\nin custody pending bond. Buckhalter
    and cornerback Darrel Crutchfield, an\nundrafted free agent from Clemson, were
    released on Saturday morning and\nwill not face charges. Carroll was to have been
    deactivated for the game at\nDallas and might not have made the trip anyway.\n\n\"We
    are obviously aware of the incident involving three of our first-year\nplayers
    last night in Philadelphia,\" said Reid in a statement released by\nthe club.
    \"I've met with the players that I could meet with this morning and\nthey will
    be suspended for this Sunday's game. . . . We will not have any\nfurther comment
    on this matter and we will handle the rest of this situation\ninternally.\"\n\nThe
    players will each be docked $12,294, the equivalent of one game check\nbased on
    their rookie minimum base salaries of $209,000. More significant\nfor Carroll
    is that he almost certainly will be in violation of the NFL's\npersonal conduct
    policy and may also have violated the substance abuse\npolicy.\n\nA fourth-round
    draft choice from Nebraska, the hard-running Buckhalter has\nrushed for 428 yards
    and two touchdowns on 92 carries this year, starting\nseveral games in place of
    the injured Duce Staley. Although Staley has\nreturned to the starting lineup,
    and had his best game of the season last\nweek, Buckhalter is still a key part
    of the Eagles offense.\n\n\n[ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [  OUR VIEW  ] ] ] ] ] ] ]
    ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ]\n\n\nShaking the head here.   Bottom line is this has a positive
    effect on\nStaley.\n\nThanks to Footballguy Mike Green for pointing me to this

    using all the features available; and \nanswers to your player-related questions
    from the \"Gridiron \nGuru.\" \n\n\nPLAN FOR THE PLAYOFFS\n\nThe Fantasy season
    is nearing its end, and the playoffs are\non the horizon. For Fantasy 2001 players,
    the playoffs begin\nwith NFL week 15 (games of Dec. 22-23) and last two weeks,
    \nwith the championship game in week 16 (games of Dec. 29-30.)\n\nIf you're in
    a Football Commissioner league, go to Schedule, \nPlayoffs to see when your playoffs
    start and how many rounds \nthey last. Of course, the matchups are probably still
    not \ndetermined, so you may not see teams listed in the brackets. \nThe commissioner
    of your league is responsible for adding \nthe teams to your playoff brackets
    at the end of your \nregular season. \n\nIf your team is still in contention,
    go to \nNFL Teams, Schedule and take note of the NFL teams with byes \nduring
    your playoff weeks, so you know which players will be \navailable if - and WHEN
    - your team competes in a playoff \nmatchup.\n\n\nGAME-BY-GAME ANALYSIS\n\nGo
    to Players, Game Log to see how a particular player did\nin each game this season.
    The player's statistics in the \ncommon categories will be displayed for each
    game. If you\nare breaking down free agents, the game log is great way to\nsee
    who's been getting the most consistent production.\n\n\nMVP.com \n\nSave 10% on

    GRIDIRON GURU\n\nWelcome to Gridiron Guru, where we'll answer your questions \nabout
    players and offer Fantasy Football roster advice. We \ninvite you to send your
    own scouting reports and comments on \nplayers to: gridguru@commissioner.com.
    You'll get the chance \nto be heard by thousands of Fantasy players just like
    \nyourself! \n\n\nMike Blake: I'm having trouble filling my No. 2 WR spot. \nShould
    I start Az-Zahir Hakim, Todd Pinkston or Muhsin \nMuhammad in week ten? \n\nG.G.
    - Hakim is a hit-or-miss type, so he's risky. Pinkston \nhas done nothing in his
    last four games, and he's losing \nplaying time to Freddie Mitchell. Muhammad
    bounced back from \na few bad performances to catch six passes for 75 yards last
    \nweekend against St. Louis, and has had some past success \nagainst this week's
    opponent, San Francisco. Go with \nMuhammad. \n\nRussell Brown: My league starts
    2 QBs. Donovan McNabb is one \nof my starters. Who else should I start? I have
    Tom Brady, \nVinny Testaverde and Doug Flutie.   \n\nG.G. - Testaverde's Fantasy
    value has taken a real hit this \nseason because of the Jets' conservative offense.
    Flutie \nstruggled last week against a bad Denver secondary, and \nwon't have
    an easier time against Oakland. We'd suggest \nplaying Brady, who will start against
    St. Louis despite the \nreturn of Drew Bledsoe. Brady has thrown 11 touchdowns
    in \nhis last five games, and is playing too well to bench. \n\nChris Gilcrest:
    Who would you start at QB this weekend: Rich \nGannon or Kerry Collins? Which
    one of these four RBs would \nyou bench: Eddie George, Michael Pittman, Mike Anderson,
    \nCurtis Martin?  \n\nG.G. - Collins has the better matchup of the two QBs, but
    \nhe's far too inconsistent to start over a player like \nGannon. Oakland will
    be looking to bounce back from a subpar \nperformance against Seattle, so look
    for Gannon to have a \nsolid game. As for your second question, bench Mike \nAnderson.
    You can't bench Martin, no matter how bad the \nmatchup may be. George has four
    touchdowns in his last three \ngames against Cincinnati, and is worth starting
    despite his \nstruggles this season; and Pittman's matchup against Detroit \nis
    too good to ignore. \n\n\nFANTASY FOOTBALL GUIDES\n\nWant to win your Fantasy

    OF THE WEEK\n\nKeith Simmons, Boulder, CO: Can Terrell Davis ever stay \nhealthy?
    He comes back and teases Fantasy owners with his \nsolid play over the last two
    weeks, only to fall prey to \nanother knee injury this past Sunday. He was once
    the best \nFantasy player in the league, but now Davis is an \nunreliable, injury-prone

    to see when your playoffs start and how many rounds\nthey last. Of course, the
    matchups are probably still not\ndetermined, so you may not see teams listed in
    the brackets.\nThe commissioner of your league is responsible for adding\nthe
    teams to your playoff brackets at the end of your\nregular season.<p>\n\nIf your
    team is still in contention, go to\n<b><i>NFL Teams, Schedule</i></b> and take
    note of the NFL teams with byes\nduring your playoff weeks, so you know which
    players will be\navailable if - and WHEN - your team competes in a playoff\nmatchup.\n</font></p></td>

    Pinkston\nhas done nothing in his last four games, and he's losing\nplaying time
    to Freddie Mitchell. Muhammad bounced back from\na few bad performances to catch

    an easier time against <b>Oakland</b>. We'd suggest \nplaying Brady, who will
    start against <b>St. Louis</b> despite the \nreturn of <b>Drew Bledsoe</b>. Brady

    face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"> \n<!-- Q3 answer -->\nCollins has the better matchup
    of the two QBs, but \nhe's far too inconsistent to start over a player like \nGannon.
    Oakland will be looking to bounce back from a subpar \nperformance against Seattle,
    so look for Gannon to have a \nsolid game. As for your second question, bench
    Mike \nAnderson. You can't bench Martin, no matter how bad the \nmatchup may be.
    George has four touchdowns in his last three \ngames against <b>Cincinnati</b>,
    and is worth starting despite his \nstruggles this season; and Pittman's matchup
    against <b>Detroit</b> \nis too good to ignore. \n</p></font></td> \n</tr> \n</table>

    FACE=\"Arial, Helvetica\"><FONT SIZE=2>\nConwell has had a few down weeks, so
    starting him on your Fantasy team is somewhat of a gamble. With the lack of depth
    at tight end around the league, however, starting Conwell is something many Fantasy
    owners will have no choice but to do. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=\"http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=69677&random=1558&key=1456&\"><B>Richard

    weekend against San Francisco, but don't be surprised if he splits carries with

  subject: Holiday Party - Canceled
  body: ! '

    I know that this is a difficult time for all of us.  With everything going on
    inside the company as well as in the world around us, we have been carefully considering
    whether a holiday celebration is appropriate this year.  To be honest, employee
    feedback has been mixed.  Many viewed the holiday party as a unique opportunity
    for us to come together as Enron employees to share the spirit of the season.  Others
    felt a holiday party would be improper given the company''s current circumstances.


    After weighing these points of view, we have ultimately decided to cancel the
    all-Enron holiday party that was scheduled for December 8.  Given what has transpired
    over the past month, it could be considered imprudent for Enron to incur the expense
    of such an event.  I regret that this action is necessary because I recognize
    that your hard work throughout the year merits a holiday celebration and so much
    more.  We will attempt to find other, more appropriate ways to recognize your
    outstanding contributions as we move into the holiday season.

  subject: SEC Information/Earnings Restatement
  body: ! "\nToday we released additional information about our related party and
    off-balance sheet transactions.  We have made this information available both
    on our website and in a Form 8-K filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission
    (SEC).\n\nThe information provides further details about:\n\n\t-- the $1.2 billion
    charge to shareholders' equity announced in the third quarter and the transactions
    related to that charge;\n\t-- a restatement of prior years' financial statements
    to reflect this reduction in shareholders' equity, the consolidation of     three
    entities and prior year proposed audit adjustments and reclassifications;\n\t--
    the Special Committee appointed by the Enron Board of Directors to review transactions
    between Enron and related parties; \n\t-- the LJM limited partnerships, including
    a discussion of transactions between Enron and LJM entities; and\n\t-- transactions
    between Enron and other Enron employees.\n\nThis information addresses a number
    of concerns that have been raised by our shareholders and the SEC.  As our Board's
    new Special Committee continues its review of various matters, we will continue
    to cooperate fully with the SEC in its investigation, and we will continue to
    respond to investor requests so that they can evaluate, appreciate and appropriately
    value the strength of our core businesses.  \n\nRestatement of Earnings\n\nBased
    on information that we have recently obtained, Enron and its auditors determined
    that certain off-balance sheet entities should have been included in Enron's consolidated
    financial statements pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles.  As
    a result, Enron will restate its financial statements from 1997 to 2000 and for
    the first and second quarters of 2001.  These restatements have no material effect
    on Enron's current financial position.  Here are some details included in the
    filing:\n\nNet income for each period will be impacted by the retroactive consolidation
    of Joint Energy Development Investments (JEDI) and Chewco beginning in November
    1997, the consolidation of an LJM1 subsidiary for 1999 and 2000 and prior year
    proposed audit adjustments.  Enron's current assessment indicates that the restatement
    will include:\n\n\t-- a reduction of approximately $96 million in 1997\n\t-- a
    reduction of approximately $113 million in 1998\n\t-- a reduction of approximately
    $250 million in 1999 \n\t-- a reduction of approximately $132 million in 2000\n\t--
    an increase of approximately $17 million for the first quarter of 2001 \n\t--
    an increase of approximately $5 million for the second quarter of 2001\n\t-- a
    reduction of $17 million for the third quarter of 2001.  \n\nThe consolidation
    of JEDI and Chewco also will increase Enron's debt by approximately $711 million
    in 1997, $561 million in 1998, $685 million in 1999 and $628 million in 2000.\n\nThe
    restatement will have no material impact on Enron's reported earnings for the
    nine-month period ending September 2001.\n\nYou can obtain more detailed information
    on the items described above by accessing the Form 8-K filing at <http://www.enron.com/corp/sec/>.\n\nWe
    will continue to review our strategic, operational and financial position, and
    we will continue to keep you updated on any developments."

  body: ! "Hi Folks,\n\nOur Footballguy Scott Luebke takes a look at this week's Upgrades,\nDowngrades
    and Waiver Wire Picks.\n\nHave a great week.\n\nJoe\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\n\nUpgrades
    \  By Scott Luebke\n\n\nQB - Brett Favre - Favre continues to prove why he is
    one of the greatest\nquarterbacks of all time.  Unlike the last few seasons, Favre
    remains\nhealthy and continues to put up consistent fantasy numbers on a weekly\nbasis.
    \ With Bill Schroeder returning from an ankle injury, Favre's stock\ncontinues
    to rise.\n\nQB - Aaron Brooks - The inconsistent season of Aaron Brooks continues
    to\nexcite and disappoint fantasy owners.  With 347 passing yards and 2\ntouchdowns
    (Williams dropped a third touchdown) against the 49ers, Brooks\ncontinues to be
    deemed a top 8 fantasy quarterback.  Keep him in your lineup\nand live with the
    ups and downs.  Brooks could put up explosive numbers\nduring any game.\n\nQB
    - Donovan McNabb - McNabb continues to impress and should only get better\nwith
    the development of his receiving crew.  With a favorable schedule for\nthe remainder
    of the season, look for McNabb to carry fantasy teams towards\nthe playoffs.  He
    has started to develop a quality connection with the\nspeedy James Thrash.  Also,
    McNabb is starting to develop a good balance\nbetween staying in the pocket and
    scrambling for the first down.  Look for\nthese extra rushing yards to provide
    added scoring as we head towards the\nfantasy playoffs.\n\nQB - Jay Fiedler -
    Fiedler has topped the 200 yard barrier in each of the\nlast 4 games while finding
    the end zone 6 times.  With the development of\ntalented rookie Chris Chambers,
    Fiedler has found a big play threat that\nshould electrify the Miami offense.
    \ With a favorable schedule for the\nremainder of the season, look for Fiedler
    to post solid numbers.\n\nQB - Jeff Garcia - Garcia has become a mainstay in the
    upgrades section.\nAdd another 4 touchdowns to his total.\n\nRB - Marshall Faulk
    - He's back.\n\nRB - Fred Taylor - Taylor is nearing his return to the lineup.
    \ He should be\nable to get a good tune up before the fantasy playoffs.  Let's
    hope he stays\nhealthy.\n\nRB - Shaun Alexander - Wow!  266 rushing yards and
    3 touchdowns make a good\ncase to remain the starter upon Ricky Watters return
    from injury.  Will\nHolmgren be able to justify the benching of the team's running
    back of the\nfuture.  I mean...running back of the present.  Sorry Ricky, but
    your time\nappears up in Seattle.\n\nRB - Duce Staley - Staley scorched the Vikings
    for 231 total yards and a\ntouchdown.  It appears that Staley is now at 100% health.
    \ Keep in mind,\nStaley has always been a streaky producer throughout his career.
    \ With the\nEagles offense looking sharp, Staley will most likely have longer
    hot\nstreaks than cold streaks.\n\nRB - Curtis Martin - Martin continues to look
    good on the season.  After\nbeing mired in a mini scoreless slump, Martin totaled
    3 touchdowns against\nthe Chiefs on Sunday.  With the winter weather approaching,
    quality running\nbacks like Curtis Martin will become more important.\n\nRB -
    Dominic Rhodes - With Edgerrin James expected to miss the next 2 games\nand possibly
    the remainder of the season, Rhodes steps into the starting\nrole.  Rhodes suffered
    a shoulder injury that forced him out of the first\nhalf on Sunday.  However,
    he was able to return in the second half.  Look\nfor Rhodes to be a productive
    back in the second half of the season.  This\nupgrade is not based on production,
    but rather opportunity.\n\nRB - Jerome Bettis - The Bus continues to roll in yardage
    leagues, but he\nhas been rather disappointing in scoring leagues.  With just
    two touchdowns\non the season, basic scoring league owners must be frustrated
    with Bettis.\nDon't worry, Bettis will get a fair share of touchdowns in the second
    half\nof the season.\n\nRB - Mike Anderson - The knee injury to Terrell Davis
    will make Mike\nAnderson the team's starter once again.\n\nRB - Maurice Smith
    - Smith continues to look strong as the feature back for\nthe Falcons.  Despite
    being held scoreless in the last 3 weeks, Smith\ncontinues to post quality yardage
    numbers (83, 84 and 148 yards).  When the\nFalcons become more efficient in the
    red zone with the passing game, Smith's\ntouchdown numbers will increase.\n\nRB
    - Antowain Smith - 2 consecutive 100-yard games have Antowain Smith\nowners jumping
    for joy and this deserves an upgrade.  Heck, if Antowain\nSmith makes anyone jump
    for joy, it's gotta be good.  Heck, the Patriots\noffense is producing and the
    defense is maintaining quality field position.\nIf the New England defense continues
    to play well and keep the Patriots in\nthe lead, Smith will have a quality finish
    to the season.\n\nWR - Marvin Harrison - Harrison scorched the Dolphins for 174
    yards and 3\ntouchdowns on Sunday.  With Edgerrin James likely out for the remainder
    of\nthe season, Harrison and the passing game will become the focal point of the\noffense.
    \ The return of Jerome Pathon should keep the pressure off of\nHarrison.\n\nWR
    - David Boston - 4 consecutive 100-yard receiving games and pure\ndominance at
    the wide receiver position.  Once again, I will proclaim Boston\nas the best young
    receiver in the game of football.  If the Arizona offense\nimproves efficiency,
    Boston's touchdown numbers will rise dramatically.\n\nWR - Willie Jackson - \"Slick\"
    Willie appeared invisible for a few weeks, but\nSunday's 11 catches for 167 yards
    deserves the upgrade.  Because of his\neffectiveness, look for Brooks to find
    Jackson more often.  In addition,\nBrooks appears to be showing signs of improvement
    and poise in the pocket.\n\nWR - Chris Chambers - Chambers showed his big play
    potential on Sunday and\nscored his first two touchdowns on the season.  Keep
    in mind, Chambers will\nmost likely be an inconsistent choice at receiver for
    the remainder of this\nseason.  However, he is a great option for dynasty or keeper
    leagues.\n\nWR - Bill Schroeder - Schroeder returned from an ankle injury and
    scored a\ntouchdown in addition to his 100 yards receiving.  Before his injury,\nSchroeder
    was one of the most consistent producers at the wide receiver\nposition.  Look
    for that trend to continue as long as he remains healthy.\n\nWR - Joe Horn - Horn
    has started to show signs of why he was drafted so high\nthis season.  With games
    of 121, 83 and 99 yards, to go along with 4\ntouchdowns, Horn is making patient
    fantasy owners very happy.  Keep him in\nyour lineup.\n\nWR - Terrell Owens -
    100 yards receiving and 2 more touchdowns.  News\nflash...Owens is really good.\n\nWR
    - James Thrash - Thrash is assuming the role of #1 receiver in\nPhiladelphia and
    that's a good thing with a quality talent like Donovan\nMcNabb at quarterback.
    2 more touchdowns on Sunday increase Thrash's total\nto 7 touchdowns on the season.
    \ With Todd Pinkston struggling on the\nopposite side, McNabb continues to look
    in Thrash's direction more often.\n\n\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\n\n\nDowngrades\n\nQB
    - Brian Griese - Griese has been looking good, but the ankle injury to\nRod Smith
    has me worried a little bit.  Smith's ankle is something that\nneeds to be watched,
    especially with Eddie Kennison claiming that he wants\nto retire.  If Rod Smith
    is unable to play, it may be wise to bench Griese,\nif you have a viable backup
    option.\n\nQB - Trent Green - Well, a healthy Derrick Alexander would have made
    this a\nbetter season for Green.  With two consecutive games held under 150 yards,\nGreen
    once again is downgraded.  With a thin receiving crew at his disposal,\nGreen
    will continue to be a shaky start.  If Alexander can return healthy\nafter the
    bye week, Green could produce quality numbers down the stretch.\nFor now, start
    someone else at quarterback.\n\nQB - Rob Johnson - A broken clavicle will keep
    Johnson out for 3-5 weeks.\n\nQB - Ryan Leaf - Leaf is not the answer to your
    fantasy team's problems.  If\nyou're starting Ryan Leaf, your fantasy team must
    be really bad.  Time to\nplay for next year, if you're in a keeper league.\n\nQB
    - Michael Vick - Vick remains a year or two away from becoming a viable\nfantasy
    quarterback option.  He continues to struggle with reading the\ndefense.  On a
    good note, Vick threw for his first touchdown pass this past\nSunday.\n\nRB -
    Edgerrin James - The knee injury to James appears to be more serious\nthan first
    thought.  The knee injury will keep James out for another two\nweeks and possibly
    the remainder of the season.  Make sure you have Dominic\nRhodes on your roster.
    \ This is a big blow to Edgerrin James owners.\n\nRB - LaDainian Tomlinson - Tomlinson's
    struggles continue as opposing\ndefenses have learned to shut down the Chargers
    running game.  After a\nglorious start to the season, Tomlinson has been on a
    gradual slide.  It's\nonly a matter of time before Tomlinson returns to the upgrades
    list.  Don't\nbail out on Tomlinson just yet.\n\nRB - Terrell Davis - Davis injured
    his left knee on Sunday and will likely\nmiss the next two games and possibly
    more. Davis will have arthroscopic knee\nand will miss Sunday's game against Washington
    and most likely the following\nweek's game against Dallas. With the fragility
    of Davis lately, this is not\na good sign.\n\nRB - Lamar Smith - Smith continues
    to struggle.  He has been held under 55\nyards for the 4th consecutive week.  With
    Travis Minor starting to take a\nfew carries away from Smith, Smith owners need
    to start worrying a little\nbit.  This week's game against the Jets could help
    signify the remainder of\nthe season for Smith.\n\nRB - Travis Henry - Henry and
    the Bills running game continue to struggle.\nHenry has been held under 65 yards
    in each of the last 4 games.  Keep him on\nyour bench until he begins to produce.\n\nWR
    - Muhsin Muhammad - Muhammad showed signs of life on Sunday with 75 yards\nreceiving.
    \ Keep in mind, the majority of this yardage was gained while the\nRams held a
    commanding lead.  With Matt Lytle at quarterback, no Panthers\nreceiver should
    be started.\n\nWR - Eric Moulds - 3 catches for 7 yards and an injury to the starting\nquarterback.
    \ Moulds is currently sharing the title of most disappointing\nfantasy receiver
    with Randy Moss this season.  Yuck!\n\nWR - Darnay Scott - Scott suffered a concussion
    in Sunday's game against the\nJaguars and was shut out on the day.  Concussions
    sometimes linger with\nreceivers, so this deserves a little bit of watching.  He
    is expected to be\nready for next week's game.\n\nWR - Rod Smith - Smith suffered
    an ankle injury in Sunday's game versus the\nChargers.  It is not yet known whether
    the injury will keep Smith out of\naction, but it will most likely keep him from
    performing at his normal 100%.\nThis situation bears watching.  Joe's email updates
    will keep you updated on\nthis one.\n\nWR - Todd Pinkston - Pinkston continues
    to struggle and it may be only a\nmatter of time before he loses the starting
    role to Freddie Mitchell.  If\nyou are a Pinkston owner, it may be a wise decision
    to grab Mitchell, if you\nare in a deep league.\n\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\n\nWaiver
    Wire\n\nKeep in mind, the waiver wire analysis selections are based off of 12
    and 14\nteam leagues.\n\nQB - Alex Van Pelt - With Rob Johnson out for 3-5 weeks,
    Van Pelt will step\nin and be given a chance to perform.  Keep in mind, Van Pelt
    scorched the\nJets for 268 yards and 3 touchdowns earlier this season.  He may
    be worth a\nshot.\n\nQB - Drew Bledsoe - Bledsoe has been cleared to play.  However,
    Tom Brady is\nexpected to remain the starter.  Make sure you have Bledsoe on your
    team, if\nyou have Brady.\n\nRB - Dominic Rhodes - The primary backup to the injured
    Edgerrin James. He\nwill be a quality option for the remainder of the season in
    the Colts\noffense.  James' owners should already have Rhodes on their roster.\n\nRB
    - Travis Minor - Minor displayed his explosive running skills against\nIndianapolis
    on Sunday.  He's gradually taking a few carries away from Lamar\nSmith.  With
    Smith struggling, Minor could see his role expand.  Minor is\nvery similar to
    Warrick Dunn.\n\nRB - LaMont Jordan - Jordan has gotten 17 carries in the last
    2 weeks.\nBecause of his effectiveness, he'll continue to see 5-10 carries per
    week.\nIf Martin befalls injury, Jordan would be explosive.\n\nRB - Troy Hambrick
    - Hambrick continues to produce with the absence of\nEmmitt Smith.  It is not
    apparent how long Smith will be out of action, but\nHambrick is a good option
    for right now.\n\nWR - Chris Chambers - Chambers showed his big play potential
    on Sunday and\nscored his first two touchdowns on the season.  Keep in mind, Chambers
    will\nmost likely be an inconsistent choice at receiver for the remainder of this\nseason.
    \ However, he is a great option for dynasty or keeper leagues.\n\nWR - Keith Poole
    - With Rod Smith injured (ankle) and Eddie Kennison\npondering retirement, the
    Broncos will need Poole to enter the starting\nlineup and produce.  Poole is not
    the flashiest receiver, but he has the\nability to be productive in the Denver
    offense.\n\nWR - Freddie Mitchell - Mitchell continues to see more and more action
    in\nthe Eagles offense and deserves consideration for a second half pickup.\nGrab
    him, especially if you are in a keeper league.\n\nWR - Jerome Pathon - Many fantasy
    owners dropped Pathon a few weeks ago, but\nhe is healthy now.  With the loss
    of Edgerrin James in the Colts offense,\nlook for the Colts to pass more often.
    \ Pathon could be valuable down the\nstretch.\n\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\n\nBryant

    Linda J.\nCc:\tSchoppe, Tammie; Brooks, Loretta; Lopez, Susan; Duree, Janelle\nSubject:\tMove
    Related Issues\n\nAs you all know, our move is scheduled for this weekend.  Hopefully,
    \ you and your groups are all progressing well in your preparations for the move
    this Friday. Please take the time to read the information contained in this message
    because most of the information contains reminders or FYI items and will be important
    to you and your group.  Please forward this to those in your group that may need
    this information.  \n\n?\tVoicemail instructions - Please have everyone in your
    group clear all new voicemail messages by 5:00 PM, Friday, 11/16.  All saved messages,
    greetings and recorded names will be saved.  If a message is left before cutover
    the message will be saved, but the message light will not be displayed when you
    arrive.  As a precautionary meassure please check voice mail upon your arrival
    Monday morning even if the message light isn't on.  \n\n?\tBuilding access - ECS
    will not be available for general access until Monday morning at 5:00 AM.  Due
    to the gas and power moves being combined, it is unlikely that the move team will
    be prepared for the POC's to come in on Sunday to unpack.  (Separate instructions
    will be generated for those who are needed to test trading applications.)  NOTE:
    Only those whose names have been approved and submitted to security will be allowed
    access on Sunday.\no\tMonday - 5:00 AM for all employees\n\n?\tSecurity & badges
    -  All POC team members should be familiar with the routes into ECS as we discussed
    at our recent move meeting.  Please be sure to share this information with all
    of the people in your group.  If you need additional copies of the floor plans
    that have the access routes highlighted, please contact Carli Smith (5-3473).
    Please stress to everyone to have their badges with them at all times.  No one
    will be allowed access without their badge.  If anyone tries to access the building
    from the garage via the skyring and they do not have their badge, they will be
    sent back through the garage to the street level to walk across the street to
    the round kiosk in the Enron building lobby to get a guest pass and then proceed
    back to ECS via the 2nd floor and the skyring.\n\n?\tMove team colors - As mentioned
    at the move meeting, the following is a list of the color designations (vests)
    for the various teams that will be on the floor when we move in.  \no\tRed - Move
    Team\no\tOrange - Desktop Support/IT\no\tGreen - Telephony\n\n?\tNewspaper subscriptions
    - The delivery location for all newspaper subscriptions need to be changed to
    ECS 05/06.  It is our intention to have all daily newspapers delivered to the
    mail desk located in the ECS 2nd floor corridor.  It will be the responsibility
    of the assistants to either pick up the papers for their group or designate someone
    in their group to pick up the papers.  If your papers continue to be delivered
    to your old floor of ECN, contact Sunny Rodgers (3-6116).\n\n?\tMove boxes -  Please
    encourage your group to pack and bring no more than about 6 boxes per person.
    \ You may call Facilities (3-6300) if you need to request additional boxes.\n\n?\tMove
    labels -  If you run out of labels or if you are missing any labels, please call
    Carli Smith (5-3473) to have additional or missing labels printed.\n\n?\tLaptops
    - Important - Please ensure that all cable locks have been removed from all laptop
    computers by 5:00 PM on Friday.  If any cable locks are left on the computers
    they will be destroyed by the move team in order to move the computers as scheduled.\n\n.\tBottled
    water - Every kitchen has an ice machine that also dispenses filtered water.  The
    large bottles of water (5 gallon) will not be allowed on the floor.  We would
    also like   to discourage the use of small bottles of water due to limited storage
    space and the availability of filtered water at several locations.  \n\n?\tPhone
    sets - Although most of you are aware of this, we just wanted to remind you that
    there will be only one phone on each desk - either a turret or an Avaya, but not
    both.  Do not tag your phones, a new phone will be waiting for each person on
    their desk in the new building\n\nI hope I have covered some of the outstanding
    questions or issues you might have, but if I have missed something, please let
    me know.  Thanks so much for all your help and hard work.\n\n"

  subject: ! '[Footballguys] Update # 155 11-16 Week 10 Passing Matchups'
  body: ! "Hi Folks,\n\nHere's how I see the Passing Game Matchups this week.\n\nPLEASE
    NOTE:   See the cheatsheets online at www.footballguys.com  for\nexactly where
    I rank players and to determine who to start.   I always\nreceive emails asking
    me how I can have a guy ranked highly on the\ncheatsheet but listed under a matchup
    that favors the Defense.   Just\nbecause one matchup may be more favorable than
    another, that doesn't\nnecessarily mean I'd start the player with the best matchup.
    \  Peyton\nManning may have a horrible matchup one week but unless you're sitting
    on\nKurt Warner or Daunte Culpepper, Manning's your guy no matter who he's\nlining
    up against.   The matchup info is meant to be just one more tool in\nyour box
    when it comes to deciding between players.\n\nNote:  I've used the player stats
    sorted by performance over the last four\nweeks extensively in developing these
    write-ups. Stats are provided by Mike\nHall's excellent FLM League Management
    Software.  http://www.fflm.com/ for\nmore info.   The points scored by position
    data is from our Footballguy\nClayton Gray.  The Target and Redzone Data is from
    our Footballguy Andy\nHicks.\nLet's get to it.\n\nJoe\n\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\nPassing
    Game Matchups to Avoid and Exploit\n\n\nLocks:  These games feature Defenses that
    should be overmatched against the\nOffense.\n\n\nArizona Passing Game vs Detroit
    Defense\n\nIf you're going to roll the dice on Jake Plummer, this is the week
    against\nthe Lions who rank # 23 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last
    four\nweeks.   The Lions rank # 31 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 25 in\nFantasy
    Points Allowed to WRs.   WR David Boston is a bonafide All Pro and\nis worthy
    of starting in any league, even with Plummer.\n\n\nDenver Passing Game vs Washington
    Defense\n\nQB Brian Griese gets healthy and now finds himself with no WRs to throw
    to.\nEddie Kennison suffered a brain cramp last week and retired / unretired /\nwas
    cut.   He didn't contribute much anyways but with Rod Smith hobbled with\nan ankle
    injury, the Broncos are dangerously thin.   Smith says he'll play\nthough.   TE
    Desmond Clark and Dwayne Carswell could see more action.   The\nRedskin defense
    is awful ranking # 31 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over\nthe last four weeks
    so you have to like the matchup.\n\n\nIndianapolis Passing Game vs New Orleans
    Defense\n\nPeyton Manning looks like he'll be ready to go, broken jaw and all.\nThey'll
    need him as Edgerrin James looks to be done for the year.   I'd\nexpect you'll
    see Manning lean heavily on Marvin Harrison to carry the load.\nJerome Pathon
    re-aggravated his foot and may not even play this week.\nReggie Wayne and Terrence
    Wilkins will be the other WRs.   New Orleans ranks\n# 29 in Passing Yards Allowed
    Per Game over the last four weeks so they're\nvery beatable.   For the year, they
    rank # 20 in Fantasy Points Allowed to\nQBs and # 23 in Fantasy Points Allowed
    to WRs.\n\n\nNew Orleans Passing Game vs Indianapolis Defense\n\nQB Aaron Brooks
    finally played like we all were expecting last week.   With\n347 yards and 2 TDs
    (plus another sure TD dropped by Ricky Williams), let's\nhope this is what Brooks
    needed to get going.   WRs Joe Horn and Willie\nJackson looked great and should
    continue to roll.   Indianapolis ranks # 28\nin Passing Yards Allowed Per Game
    over the last four weeks so they shouldn't\npresent too much of a problem.\n\n\nNew
    York Giants Passing Game vs Minnesota Defense\n\nQB Kerry Collins will likely
    be thinking of last year's NFC Championship\ngame where he toasted the Vikings.
    \  It could happen again as the Giants are\nrolling while Minnesota is struggling.
    \  WRs Amani Toomer, Ike Hilliard and\nJoe Jurevicius will see action.   The Giants
    are a run first team but that\nopens the pass as teams focus on stopping Ron Dayne
    and Tiki Barber.   The\nVikings rank # 21 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over
    the last four\nweeks.\n\n\nSan Francisco Passing Game vs Carolina Defense\n\nQB
    Jeff Garcia and WR Terrell Owens are no brainer starts against the AFC\nPro Bowl
    Team so I think they'll probably warrant starts against the Panther\ndefense that
    ranks # 26 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four\nweeks.   WR Tai
    Streets is worth a gamble as is our favorite Yale grad, TE\nEric Johnson.   Greg
    Clark hasn't been healthy in years it seems.\n\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\n\nPrime
    Matchups:  These games feature Defenses that should have trouble\nstopping the
    Offense.\n\n\nBaltimore Passing Game vs Cleveland Defense\n\nElvis Grbac looks
    to be taking a step backwards as he looked uncomfortable\nin the pocket last week.
    \  Look for the Ravens to run the ball to take\npressure off the passing game.
    \  This is a good matchup for Baltimore as the\nBrowns rank # 25 in Passing Yards
    Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.\nQadry Ismail was the big WR last week
    with 129 yards and a TD.   Brandon\nStokely is in the WR mix as well as the up
    and down Travis Taylor.   TE\nShannon Sharpe is always a threat.\n\n\nCincinnati
    Passing Game vs Tennessee Defense\n\nThe strength of this team is Corey Dillon
    and running the ball.   Kitna\nthrew 48 passes last week and that won't continue.
    \  With T.J.\nHoushmandzadeh becoming a factor, the Bengals are getting back to
    the 3 WR\nsets that were effective before Chad Johnson was injured.   That's a
    big\nplus.   The Titans rank # 30 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last\nfour
    weeks so they're definitely vulnerable.   For the year, Tennessee ranks\n# 27
    in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 30 in Fantasy Points Allowed to\nWRs.\n\n\nDetroit
    Passing Game vs Arizona Defense\n\nCharlie Batch is throwing the ball a lot and
    that's just fine for his\nowners.   The problem is he doesn't have many guys who
    can catch it.\nLamont Warren and Corey Schlesinger caught more passes than WR
    Johnnie\nMorton last week.   That needs to change.   The Cardinals rank # 11 in\nPassing
    Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks but they're not that\ngood.   For
    the year, they rank # 23 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and #\n21 in Fantasy
    Points Allowed to WRs.\n\n\nGreen Bay Passing Game vs Atlanta Defense\n\nFavre's
    playing as well as ever.   Start him.  I'd start both Antonio\nFreeman and Billy
    Schroeder as well.   Having Schroeder back clearly is a\nbig plus for Favre.   TE
    Bubba Franks is always worth a shot as well.   The\nFalcons rank # 10 in Passing
    Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks\nso they're no pushover.   Although
    that's an improvement from where the\nFalcons have been.   For the year, they
    still rank # 30 in Fantasy Points\nAllowed to QBs and # 31 in Fantasy Points Allowed
    to WRs.   I'd feel good\nabout all the Packers here.\n\n\nOakland Passing Game
    vs San Diego Defense\n\nRich Gannon put together another solid game throwing for
    257 yards and 2\nTDs.   With guys like Tim Brown and Jerry Rice to throw to, that
    doesn't\nhurt your chances.   He'll be facing a Charger Defense that's struggled
    a\nbit and now ranks # 20 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four\nweeks.
    \  Safety Rodney Harrison will likely miss this week and that hurts.\n\n\nPittsburgh
    Passing Game vs Jacksonville Defense\n\nThis team is about Jerome Bettis and running
    the football but part of\nBettis' success has to be attributed to the revival
    of the passing game.\nStewart offers enough of a threat that defenses must honor
    the pass.   Hines\nWard is productive but he's about the only player from the
    passing game I\ncan see starting in your league.   It is enticing this week though
    as the\nJaguars rank just # 24 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last
    four\nweeks.\n\n\nSt. Louis Passing Game vs New England Defense\n\nQB Kurt Warner's
    thumb responded well to treatment this week and looks good\nto go.   That's bad
    news for Patriot fans.   The New England Defense ranks #\n19 in Passing Yards
    Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   Isaac Bruce\nand Torry Holt are must
    starts every week even against a giant killer team\nlike New England.   Marshall
    Faulk is back in full swing and he'll be a\nmajor part of the passing game again.\n\n\nTampa
    Bay Passing Game vs Chicago Defense\n\nQB Brad Johnson is starting to feel the
    comfort zone it seems although he's\nstill dinking and dunking the ball (5.22
    yards per attempt last week)   It's\nbasically Johnson (Brad) throwing to Johnson
    (Keyshawn)   The Bears are not\nnearly as tough defending the pass as they are
    the run.   They rank # 27 in\nPassing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four
    weeks.   Could be a good\nmatchup.\n\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\n\nEven
    Matchups:  These games feature no real advantage either way\n\n\nBuffalo Passing
    Game vs Seattle Defense\n\nAlex Van Pelt takes over and that could be a spark
    the Bills need.   WRs\nPeerless Price and Eric Moulds should be more involved.
    \  Or on the other\nhand, maybe we'll find Rob Johnson wasn't as bad as his OL
    made him look.\nWe'll see.   Van Pelt probably isn't a starting QB anywhere (his
    last start\nwas in 1997) but he might be worth a shot if you're desperate.   Seattle
    is\nan average defense ranked # 12 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the\nlast
    four weeks.   But for the year, they rank # 29 in Fantasy Points\nAllowed to QBs
    and # 24 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.\n\n\nCleveland Passing Game vs Baltimore
    Defense\n\nQB Tim Couch spread the offense out to beat Baltimore earlier this
    year and\nI'd look for them to employ a similar tactic this week.   He's steady.
    \  WR\nKevin Johnson is clearly still his primary target.   The Ravens are tough
    on\nthe run defense but rank # 22 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the\nlast
    four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 12 in Fantasy Points Allowed to\nQBs and
    # 10 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.   Tough matchup but don't\ncount out Couch.\n\n\nDallas
    Passing Game vs Philadelphia Defense\n\nLeaf started his Dallas career with an
    unremarkable 14 of 22 for 114 yard\nday.   1 TD and 1 Int.   I guess it could
    have been worse.   He'll have\nanother week of practice under the belt.   The
    Eagles are pretty average\nlately on defense ranking # 13 in Passing Yards Allowed
    Per Game over the\nlast four weeks.   For the year, they're tough though ranking
    # 3 in Fantasy\nPoints Allowed to QBs and # 4 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.
    \  This\ndoesn't look promising for Leaf or WRs Joey Galloway / Raghib Ismail\nalthough
    both are big play guys and it only takes a few seconds for them to\nmake your
    weekend.   They will have a speed advantage over the more physical\nEagle Corners.\n\n\nNew
    York Jets Passing Game vs Miami Defense\n\nVinnie Testeverde looks to have his
    exciting rookie WR, Santana Moss\navailable for his debut game this week.   Could
    be interesting as Dolphin\nCornerback Sam Madison is injured and Moss could make
    things interesting if\nthe Jets turn him loose.   Wayne Chrebet may be limited
    with a bad shoulder.\nLaveranues Coles has been up and down.   The Dolphins rank
    # 14 in Passing\nYards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks but clearly,
    will miss\nMadison.\n\n\nPhiladelphia Passing Game vs Dallas Defense\n\nDonovan
    McNabb continues his outstanding play.   WR James Thrash has clearly\nidentified
    himself as the prime WR over Todd Pinkston.   Young Freddie\nMitchell is coming
    on strong too.   The Cowboys are pretty tough on defense\nranking # 7 in Passing
    Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.\nAlthough for the year, they
    rank # 19 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and #\n19 in Fantasy Points Allowed
    to WRs.   This team may decide to keep it on\nthe ground though given the huge
    success they had running the ball last week\nwith Duce Staley and Correll Buckhalter.\n\n\nTennessee
    Passing Game vs Cincinnati Defense\n\nSteve McNair sat out of Thursday's practice
    nursing his bad hand.   His\nstatus for Sunday isn't clear yet.   Although he's
    normally a question mark\neach week.   His # 1 target, TE Frank Wycheck is hobbling
    too with an ankle\nbut hopes to be ready by Sunday.   WRs Kevin Dyson and Derrick
    Mason are\nplaying well lately.   The Bengals are average ranking # 15 in Passing
    Yards\nAllowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank #
    24 in\nFantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 22 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.
    \  K\neep an eye on McNair's hand here.\n\n\nWashington Passing Game vs Denver
    Defense\n\nI'll admit to being surprised at the success Tony Banks has had but
    you have\nto give the guy his due.   He's stretching the defenses and making good\nreads.
    \  And WRs Michael Westbrook and Rod Gardner seem to play hard for\nhim.   They'll
    face a Denver Defense ranked # 16 in Passing Yards Allowed\nPer Game over the
    last four weeks.   Denver held Doug Flutie in check last\nweek so that's some
    worry.   TE Stephen is still looking very iffy for\nSunday.\n\n\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\n\nDownside
    Matchups:  These games feature a Defense that could pose trouble\nfor the Offense.\n\n\nAtlanta
    Passing Game vs Green Bay Defense\n\nQB Chris Chandler was able to practice Thursday
    and that's great news.   The\nFalcons struggled without him.   WR Shawn Jefferson
    led all receivers last\nweek - with 2 catches.   Ouch.   Hopefully, with Chandler
    back, Jefferson,\nTerence Mathis and Tony Martin will do better.   On the flip
    side, Chandler\nis his usual one shot away from the bench.   It won't be easy
    though against\na tough Packer defense that ranks # 8 in Passing Yards Allowed
    Per Game over\nthe last four weeks.\n\n\nCarolina Passing Game vs San Francisco
    Defense\n\nUgliness all around here.   George Seifert has to look across at those
    49er\nuniforms and wonder how it came to this.   QB Chris Weinke is reportedly\nlooking
    pretty good in practice but coach Seifert was reluctant to name him\nthe starter.
    \  If he can't go, Matt Lytle will start.   WR Muhsin Muhammad\nand TE Wesley
    Walls are maybe worth the gamble but their stock is certainly\nslipping with the
    QB play.   San Francisco is ranked # 18 in Passing Yards\nAllowed Per Game over
    the last four weeks.\n\n\nChicago Passing Game vs Tampa Bay Defense\n\nLook for
    QB Jim Miller to keep it pretty conservative in the passing scheme.\nTampa ranks
    # 5 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.\nThe Bears want
    to run Anthony Thomas and throw enough to keep the Bucs off\nbalance.   When they
    do throw, look for multiple WR sets as they work rookie\nDavid Terrell into the
    mix with Marty Booker and Dez White.\n\n\nMinnesota Passing Game vs New York Giants
    Defense\n\nWith the Vikings running game in disarray, look for them to air it
    out\nagainst a tough New York Defense.   QB Daunte Culpepper will have his work\ncut
    out for him against the Giant defense ranked # 6 in Passing Yards\nAllowed Per
    Game over the last four weeks.   Like Kerry Collins, you can bet\nhe'll be thinking
    of the NFC Championship game from a year ago where his\nteam fell apart.   Randy
    Moss and Cris Carter are starters in most leagues\njust on potential alone.   TE
    Byron Chamberlain could be a factor as well.\n\n\nNew England Passing Game vs
    St. Louis Defense\n\nQB Drew Bledsoe proclaimed himself ready to start but Tom
    Brady gets the nod\nagain this week.   No promises for next week but it'll be
    hard to keep\nBledsoe's salary on the bench.   We'll see.   Brady's been solid.
    \  WRs Troy\nBrown and David Patten need to re-engage and become a bigger part
    of the\noffense.   The Rams are tough ranking # 4 in Passing Yards Allowed Per
    Game\nover the last four weeks.\n\n\nSan Diego Passing Game vs Oakland Defense\n\nIs
    the \"Flutie Magic\" wearing off?   He certainly looked mortal last week.\nThis
    week, he'll be without TE Freddie Jones.   Even though Jones wasn't\nbeing utilized
    much, he was still a nice outlet.   Tim Dwight is still out\nwith a collapsed
    lung so that leaves WRs Curtis Conway and Jeff Graham to\ncarry the load.   Both
    are capable.   Oakland's Charles Woodson may be\nlimited with a bad foot and that'll
    help.   The Raiders rank # # 9 in\nPassing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last
    four weeks.   They rank # 21in\nFantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 12 in Fantasy
    Points Allowed to WRs.\n\n\nSeattle Passing Game vs Buffalo Defense\n\nMatt Hasselbeck
    offered a glimmer of hope last week and hopes to build on\nthat success.   As
    long as Shaun Alexander is running wild, Hasselbeck\ncertainly has a chance with
    the play action pass.   Darrell Jackson in\nparticular is looking better and Koren
    Robinson will work against a tough\nset of Cornerbacks.   The Bills rank # 2 in
    Passing Yards Allowed Per Game\nover the last four weeks and have 16 sacks over
    the last 4 games so this\nwill be no cakewalk.\n\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\n\nDefensive
    Slam Dunks:  These games feature a very tough Defense posing major\nproblems for
    the Offense.\n\n\nJacksonville Passing Game vs Pittsburgh Defense\n\nMark Brunell
    and crew will have their work cut out for them as they face a\nmuch better Steeler
    team than they saw in week 1.   The Steelers rank # 3 in\nPassing Yards Allowed
    Per Game over the last four weeks.  WRs Jimmy Smith\nand Keenan McCardell both
    scored last week and continue to put up quality\nnumbers.   The Steelers will
    throw Cornerbacks Dewayne Washington and Chad\nScott who are very solid.   Plus,
    the defense has recorded 23 sacks over the\nlast 4 weeks.   Tough matchup.\n\n\nMiami
    Passing Game vs New York Jets Defense\n\nQB Jay Fiedler quietly put a very nice
    game together last week with 259\nyards and 2 TDs.   His WRs are solid and our
    guy Chris Chambers had a\nbreakout game with 2 TDs.   Oronde Gadsden is quietly
    putting together a\nnice season.   The Jets rank # 1 in Passing Yards Allowed
    Per Game over the\nlast four weeks though so it'll likely be tough.   They rank
    # 4 in Fantasy\nPoints Allowed to QBs for the year and # 8 in Fantasy Points Allowed
    to WRs.\nI'd look for the Dolphins to try and exploit their much softer run defense.\n\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\nBryant

  body: ! "\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\nHi Folks,\n\nHere's
    how I see the Rushing Game Matchups this week.\n\nPLEASE NOTE:   See the cheatsheet
    online www.footballguys.com for exactly\nwhere I rank players and to determine
    who to start.   I always receive\nemails asking me how I can have a guy ranked
    highly on the cheatsheet but\nlisted under a matchup that favors the Defense.
    \  Just because one matchup\nmay be more favorable than another, that doesn't
    necessarily mean I'd start\nthe player with the best matchup.   Ahman Green may
    have a horrible matchup\none week but unless you're sitting on Edgerrin James
    or Marshall Faulk,\nGreen's your guy no matter who he's lining up against.   The
    matchup info is\nmeant to be just one more tool in your box when it comes to deciding
    between\nplayers.\n\nStats are provided by Mike Hall's excellent FLM League Management
    Software.\nhttp://www.fflm.com/ for more info.   Fantasy Points Allowed by position\nnumbers
    are from ESPN.com.   Red Zone and Target numbers are from our\nFootballguy Andy
    Hicks.\nLet's get to it.\n\nJoe\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\nRushing
    Game Matchups\n\n\nLocks:  These games feature Defenses that should be overmatched
    against the\nOffense.\n\n\nBaltimore's Jason Brookins vs Cleveland Defense\n\nWith
    Terry Allen out, Jason Brookins gets the starting nod.   He fared\npretty well
    against the Titans Monday with 57 yards on 14 carries (4.1 ypc)\nThe Browns run
    defense is soft ranking just # 28 in Rushing Yards Allowed\nper Game over the
    last four weeks.   With QB Elvis Grbac looking a little\nshaky in his return,
    I'd expect you'll see Brookins pound the ball against a\nweak run defense.\n\n\nGreen
    Bay's Ahman Green vs Atlanta Defense\n\nGreen rolled for 93 yards on 18 carries
    (5.2 ypc) last week against a nasty\nChicago run defense.   This week he faces
    a soft Falcon defense that ranks #\n24 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over
    the last four weeks.   Start\nGreen...\n\n\nNew York Giant's Ron Dayne / Tiki
    Barber vs Minnesota Defense\n\nWith their outstanding running game last week,
    look for the Giants to\ncontinue rolling on the ground.   Both Dayne and Barber
    had 3 Red Zone\ntouches last week.   Barber could be more effective in this game
    as he takes\nadvantage of the fast track in the Metrodome.   Minnesota is awful
    defending\nthe run ranking # 31 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last
    four\nweeks.   They rank # 30 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.   I'd feel good\nstarting
    either one of these guys.\n\n\nSan Francisco's Garrison Hearst / Kevan Barlow
    vs Carolina Defense\n\nHearst ran wild last week totaling 145 yards on 17 carries
    (8.5 ypc)\nCoupled with the Jeff Garcie / Terrell Owens tandem, that's a pretty
    tough\noffense.   Things look even better this week against an awful Carolina\ndefense
    ranked # 29 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four\nweeks.   For
    the year, they rank # 28 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.\nKevan Barlow will
    stay #2 as long as Hearst continues to put up numbers like\nthis.   Plus, Barlow
    is slowed with a quad injury.   Looks like a great\nmatchup for Hearst.\n\n\nSt.
    Louis' Marshall Faulk vs New England Defense\n\nI'm not going to insult your intelligence.
    \  Start Marshall Faulk.\n\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\n\nPrime
    Matchups:  These games feature Defenses that should have trouble\nstopping the
    Offense.\n\n\nArizona's Michael Pittman vs Detroit Defense\n\nPittman started
    to get back on track a bit last week with 54 yards on 17\ncarries (3.2 ypc)   He'll
    face a soft Lion defense this week that ranks # 27\nin Rushing Yards Allowed per
    Game over the last four weeks.   For the year,\nthey rank # 25 in Fantasy Points
    Allowed to RBs.   Pittman should find room\nto run if QB Jake Plummer and WR David
    Boston can soften the defense just a\nlittle.\n\n\nChicago's Anthony Thomas vs
    Tampa Bay Defense\n\nAfter a strong start last week against the tough Packer Defense,
    Anthony\nThomas was shut down.   He'll face a Tampa defense this week that's bark
    is\nworse than it's bite.   They talk pretty big but only rank # 20 in Rushing\nYards
    Allowed per Game over the last four weeks.   They rank # 17 in Fantasy\nPoints
    Allowed to RBs.   We'll see what kind of resiliency Thomas has and if\nhe can
    get back on track.   Lots will depend on the Bear passing attack and\nif Jim Miller
    can throw downfield enough to loosen the safeties.\n\n\nDetroit's Rueben Droughns
    / Corey Schlesinger vs Arizona Defense\n\nIt's an interesting matchup here.   James
    Stewart is out again and the combo\nof Droughns and Schlesinger will run the ball.
    \  Droughns totaled just 30\nyard on 13 carries last week (2.3 ypc)   Even worse,
    was Schlesinger who\nmanaged just 13 yards on 7 carries (1.9 ypc)   On the upside,
    both managed a\nTD and both were very active in the Red Zone.   This week, they'll
    face a\nweak Arizona defense that ranks # 25 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game
    over\nthe last four weeks and # 22 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.   If you've\nbeen
    thinking about starting a Lion RB, now's your chance.\n\n\nMiami's Lamar Smith
    / Travis Minor vs New York Jets Defense\n\nLamar Smith has me worried a bit as
    he continues to look less than stellar\nwhile Travis Minor slashes up the defense.
    \  Smith had 53 yards on 18\ncarries (2.9 ypc) Sunday while Minor ripped off 71
    yards on just 7 carries\n(10.1 ypc)   The good news is that the Jets run defense
    is still pretty bad.\nThey've improved recently but still rank # 23 in Rushing
    Yards Allowed per\nGame over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank #
    26 in Fantasy\nPoints Allowed to RBs.   If you've been starting Smith, I'd stick
    with him\nfor at least this game.   He did have 2 red zone rushes last week while\nMinor
    had none.   If you're in the gambling mood, I might roll the dice with\nMinor.\n\n\nNew
    Orleans' Ricky Williams vs Indianapolis Defense\n\nWilliams rolled up a monster
    yardage day against the 49ers last week with\n121 yards on 24 carries (5.0 ypc)
    and added 52 yards receiving to it.   And\nit should have been better as he dropped
    a sure TD in the endzone that hit\nhim right in the hands.   Needless to say,
    he's rolling.   He'll be facing a\nvery average Indy defense that ranks # 14 in
    Rushing Yards Allowed per Game\nover the last four weeks.   Although the Colts
    will be without their best\ndefensive player, OLB Mike Peterson.   The Saints
    also hope to have All Pro\nOffensive Lineman Willie Roaf back in action which
    will make the running\ngame even more formidable.\n\n\nOakland's Charlie Garner
    / Zack Crockett vs San Diego Defense\n\nCharlie Garner continues to run the ball
    between the 20's while Zack\nCrockett gets the scores.   Garner had 57 yards on
    13 carries (4.4 ypc) last\nweek but Crockett was the one with 2 TDs.   I don't
    see that changing much.\nEspecially with Tyrone Wheatley due back any time.   The
    Charger defense is\naverage ranking # 21 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over
    the last four\nweeks.\n\n\nSan Diego's LaDainian Tomlinson vs Oakland Defense\n\nLook
    for Tomlinson to try and pull a Shaun Alexander who ran wild over the\nOakland
    defense last week.   I'm guessing you'll see the Raiders stiffen a\nbit.   Tomlinson
    ran well last week but simply didn't get enough carries (14\ncarries for 75 yards
    - 5.4 ypc)   Doug Flutie is starting to look very\nvulnerable and the Chargers
    need to get back to Tomlinson and the ground\ngame.   With the awful performance
    last week, the Raider defense falls from\n# 11 to # 30 in Rushing Yards Allowed
    per Game over the last four weeks.\nIt'll be interesting to see how they respond.\n\n\nSeattle's
    Shaun Alexander vs Buffalo Defense\n\nAlexander tallied 266 rushing yards and
    3 TDs against a good Oakland defense\nlast week.   You have to start Alexander
    against the Bills that rank # 19 in\nRushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last
    four weeks.\n\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\n\nEven Matchups:
    \ These games feature no real advantage either way\n\n\nBuffalo's Travis Henry
    vs Seattle Defense\n\nTravis Henry's running hard, he just isn't being given a
    lot of\nopportunities in this offense.   He totaled 51 yards on 16 carries (3.2
    ypc)\nlast week.   I'm not sure any RB would do a lot behind that Offensive Line\nthough.
    \  He faces a Seattle defense that ranks # 22 in Rushing Yards\nAllowed per Game
    over the last four weeks.   They rank # 11 in Fantasy\nPoints Allowed to RBs so
    they're pretty tough.   The Linebacking Corps with\nLevon Kirkland could cause
    some trouble.   Although new QB Alex Van Pelt\ncould give the team a spark.\n\n\nCincinnati's
    Corey Dillon vs Tennessee Defense\n\nDillon should move back to the focus of this
    offense as the Bengals realize\nJon Kitna isn't a guy that should try to carry
    this team.   The trouble will\nbe that Tennessee defends the run very well ranking
    # 4 in Rushing Yards\nAllowed per Game over the last four weeks.   They've come
    on lately as for\nthe year, they rank # 21 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.   Like
    the\nBengals, Tennesse's Defensive Ends are undersized and that could be trouble\nfor
    a power running RB like Dillon.\n\n\nPhiladelphia's Duce Staley / Correll Buckhalter
    vs Dallas Defense\n\nLooks to me like Duce Staley is back after a great day totaling
    146 yards on\n17 carries (8.6 ypc) with a TD.   Correll Buckhalter was active
    too with 66\nyards on 11 carries (6.6 ypc) and a TD.   Part of that was the Viking\nDefense
    but you have to give credit to the Eagles.   This week, they'll face\na Dallas
    team that's ranked # 11 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the\nlast four
    weeks.   I like their chances to keep it rolling.   I like\nBuckhalter but I think
    you'll continue to see Staley garner more and more\ntime.\n\n\nPittsburgh's Jerome
    Bettis vs Jacksonville Defense\n\nJacksonville is decent against the run ranking
    # 12 in Rushing Yards Allowed\nper Game over the last four weeks but Jerome Bettis
    is pretty much a must\nstart.   He's rolling and this offense is heavily dependent
    on him to carry\nthe load.   QB Kordell Stewart and WR Hines Ward have improved
    enough to\nkeep the Defense at least somewhat honest and Bettis does the rest.\n\n\nTennessee's
    Eddie George vs Cincinnati Defense\n\nEven with Coach Jeff Fisher letting QB Steve
    McNair run the ball at the end\nof last week's wild Monday Night game, it's clear
    that Eddie George is\ngetting stronger.   It's also clear that Cincinnati is getting
    weaker on\ndefense.   Last week, they ranked # 9, this week they're down to #
    18 in\nRushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks.   The Bengals
    are\nundersized on the Defensive Line, especially at Defensive End and this could\nbe
    a nice matchup for the powerful George.\n\n\nWashington's Stephen Davis vs Denver
    Defense\n\nDavis is finally starting to pay some dividends for his patient owners\nrushing
    for 142 yards on 32 carries (4.4 ypc) in his last game.   He's\nrested after a
    bye and should be able to keep the roll going against a\nDenver Defense that ranks
    # 13 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the\nlast four weeks.   Last week,
    the Broncos yielded 75 yards to LaDainian\nTomlinson on just 14 carries (5.4 ypc)
    \  The improvement of Stephen Davis\ncan be tied directly to the better play of
    QB Tony Banks and his WRs.\nTeams can't stack the line now as they have to respect
    the deep ball.\n\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\n\nDownside
    Matchups:  These games feature a Defense that could pose trouble\nfor the Offense.\n\n\nAtlanta's
    Maurice Smith vs Green Bay Defense\n\nMaurice Smith rolled for 148 yards on 27
    carries last week against a Cowboy\ndefense that doesn't allow much on the ground.
    \  He'll face a tougher\ndefense in Green Bay this week that's ranked # 8 in Rushing
    Yards Allowed\nper Game over the last four weeks.   Although if you watched the
    Chicago -\nGreen Bay game last week, you saw Anthony Thomas have great success
    early in\nthe game running right at the Packer defense.   The Falcons are feeling
    more\ncomfortable with Smith and I'd look for them to do the same thing.   Not
    a\ngreat matchup here but one I'd not be particularly afraid of if I'm a Smith\nowner.\n\n\nDallas'
    Troy Hambrick / Emmitt Smith vs Philadelphia Defense\n\nHambrick's coming off
    a great week where he rushed for 127 yards on 20\ncarries (6.3 ypc) against a
    suspect Falcon Defense.   He'll face a pretty\ngood Eagle team ranked # 9 in Rushing
    Yards Allowed per Game over the last\nfour weeks.   Emmitt Smith practiced late
    this week and could play but with\nHambrick playing well, I doubt you'll see him
    rushed back.   Keep an eye on\nHambrick - although he's expected to play, he's
    nursing a pretty serious\nshoulder injury himself.\n\n\nDenver's Mike Anderson
    / Olandis Gary vs Washington Defense\n\nAs the Terrell Davis Saga takes another
    turn (downward), the Broncos turn\nonce again to Mike Anderson and Olandis Gary.
    \  They'll be ready.   The\ntrouble I think is that the WR corps are limping (Rod
    Smith) and goofy\n(Eddie Kennison)   Kennison is gone and Smith's ankle looks
    like something\nthat'll hopefully allow him to play but you don't know how much
    he'll be\nlimited.   Smith has been their offensive focus and if he can't go,
    the\nrunning game will be affected.   To make it worse, Washington has been\nsurprisingly
    tough against the run lately ranking # 3 in Rushing Yards\nAllowed per Game over
    the last four weeks.   Primarily because they rank #\n31 in Passing Yards Allowed
    over that same span but that doesn't really\nmatter.   Teams clearly feel they
    can throw against Washington.   Although\nwith Smith less than 100%, this might
    not be the case for Denver.   All in\nall, not a great matchup.   ESPNews was
    reporting Thursday night that\nOlandis Gary could possibly get the start.   Welcome
    to Shannyland...   See\nhow this shakes out as right now, it's looking very murky.\n\n\nIndianapolis
    Dominic Rhodes vs New Orleans Defense\n\nDominic Rhodes had a nice game in week
    8 where he rushed for 100 yards on 34\ncarries (2.9 ypc)   He found the going
    tougher last week with just 42 yards\non 14 carries (3.0 ypc)   Plus he injured
    his shoulder.   The yards per\ncarry numbers are disturbing.   On the plus side,
    Edgerrin James is out for\nat least a while and maybe the season so Rhodes is
    the man.   New Orleans\nplays a decent run defense ranking # 17 in Rushing Yards
    Allowed per Game\nover the last four weeks.   They rank # 12 in Fantasy Points
    Allowed to RBs.\nQB Peyton Manning has a broken jaw but says he'll play.   NOTE:
    \  ESPN is\nreporting now that the 2nd opinion on Edgerrin James' knee was no
    better\nthan the first and that he looks to definitely be done for the year.\n\n\nNew
    England's Antowain Smith vs St. Louis Defense\n\nAntowain Smith had to enjoy his
    game last week against his old team where he\nrushed for 100 yards on 20 carries
    (5.0 ypc) and 2 TDs.   I doubt he'll have\nthe same success against the Rams who
    rank # 5 in Rushing Yards Allowed per\nGame over the last four weeks.\n\n\nNew
    York Jet's Curtis Martin vs Miami Defense\n\nIt's still all about Curtis Martin
    in this new West Coast offense which\nlooks a lot like the old Curtis Martin Offense.
    \  Martin's coming off a\nmonster day where he rushed for 113 yards on 20 carries
    (5.7 ypc) and 3 TDs.\nHe'll face a solid Defense this week in Miami.   They rank
    # 6 in Rushing\nYards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks and # 8 in Fantasy
    Points\nAllowed to RBs.   Martin is one of the few RBs to have a lot of success\nagainst
    Miami.   Look for the Jets to ask him to do it again this week.\n\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\n\nDefensive
    Slam Dunks:  These games feature a very tough Defense posing major\nproblems for
    the Offense.\n\n\nCarolina's Richard Huntley / Nick Goings vs San Francisco Defense\n\nThis
    is U-G-L-Y   Goings was the leading rusher last week with 13 yards on 9\ncarries
    (1.4 ypc)   Huntley's done very little with his golden opportunity\nto start (7
    yards on 6 carries last week)   I'd avoid all Panthers here.\n\n\nCleveland's
    James Jackson vs Baltimore Defense\n\nJames Jackson played a gutsy game last week
    against a tough Pittsburgh\ndefense gaining 57 yards on 18 carries (3.2 ypc)   It
    won't get any easier\nthis week against the Ravens who rank # 7 in Rushing Yards
    Allowed per Game\nover the last four weeks and rank # 1 in Fantasy Points Allowed
    to RBs.\nMLB Ray Lewis continues to be a terrific run stopper along with the DTs
    Tony\nSiragusa and Sam Adams.   Back in week 6, Jackson did run for 77 yards and
    a\nTD so it's no sure thing he'll not produce - it's just a tough matchup.\n\n\nJacksonville's
    Stacey Mack / Fred Taylor vs Pittsburgh Defense\n\nThe question of the week is
    whether Taylor can play or not.   He's set to\npractice this week but it's still
    not clear how much (if any) he'll be able\nto go.   Watch this one closely.   Obviously,
    his chances are much better\nthan Mack's although Mack has shown a nose for the
    endzone and finally seems\nto be earning some points with Coach Coughlin.   Whoever
    runs the ball will\nhave a tough day as Pittsburgh ranks # 1 in Rushing Yards
    Allowed per Game\nover the last four weeks.   They rank # 4 in Fantasy Points
    Allowed to RBs\nfor the year.   Unless Taylor looks great late this week and you're
    out of\nother options, I'd look elsewhere.\n\n\nMinnesota's Doug Chapman / Michael
    Bennett vs New York Giants Defense\n\nMichael Bennett will likely play although
    we're hearing Chapman will start.\nI'm not excited about either against a tough
    New York Defense ranked # 10 in\nRushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last
    four weeks.   They rank # 2 in\nFantasy Points Allowed to RBs.   I'm guessing
    both will play and neither\nwill do a lot.\n\n\nTampa Bay's Mike Alstott / Warrick
    Dunn vs Chicago Defense\n\nGood luck figuring this running game out.   In week
    8, it was Alstott with\nall the Red Zone touches (2 rushes, 1 pass target - 1
    TD)  Last week it was\nDunn in the Red Zone (3 rushes, 1 pass target - 1 TD)   Go
    figure.   This\nweek, they'll face a tough Chicago defense still smarting from
    Ahman Green.\nThe Bears rank # 2 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last
    four\nweeks and I don't think I'd want to be catching this week.\n\n\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\n\nThat'll

    always, we'll\nkeep them updated online www.footballguys.com as this late in the
    season,\nthere are lots of injury situations that need watching.   I've included
    the\nstatus of the players that made the Official Injury Report and listed them\nas
    they appear there.   Keep in mind that teams like Tennessee hardly ever\ngive
    accurate information.   (Denver runs a distant second)   A Titan\n\"Questionable\"
    is most definitely not the same as a Jet \"Questionable\".\nStay tuned through
    the week as these shake out.\n\nI've also included Tom Nadratowski's Individual

  subject: ! '[Footballguys] BREAKING NEWS - Freddie Jones Trouble'
  body: ! "Entire story:\nhttp://www.uniontrib.com/sports/chargers/20011114-9999_1s14chargers.html\n\nAdd
    tight end Freddie Jones to the list of Chargers who won't play Sunday at\nOakland.\n\nJones
    traveled to Columbia, S.C., yesterday to get a second opinion on an\ninjured ankle
    that has limited him to one practice in the past three weeks.\nAlthough the results
    of the MRI exam won't be determined until today, a\nsource close to the situation
    said Dr. Evan Ekman of Southern Orthopedic\nSports Medicine has advised Jones
    against playing against the Raiders.\n\nThe timing couldn't be worse for the Chargers,
    who have lost two in a row\nand four of six to fall to 5-4. They already will
    be without strong safety\nRodney Harrison, special teams standout Carlos Polk
    and nickel cornerback\nAlex Molden because of injuries, and losing Jones will
    restrict offensive\ncoordindator Norv Turner's ability to run two-tight end formations.\n\nThe
    Chargers have just two other tight ends on the roster, and neither\npresents the
    threat Jones does. Steve Heiden has just four receptions this\nseason and 10 in
    his career, and Josh Whitman is a receptionless rookie who\nwas promoted off the
    practice squad last month, after being waived by\nBuffalo.\n\nJones was voted
    the team's offensive MVP last season after he led the club\nwith a career-high
    71 catches and tied for the team lead with five touchdown\nreceptions. He was
    supposed to build on that this season under Turner, but a\nbad ankle sprain suffered
    Oct. 21 against Denver changed that.\n\nThrough nine games, Jones has just 19
    catches -- 17 fewer than team leader\nCurtis Conway and just three more than rookie
    running back LaDainian\nTomlinson. Jones has participated in only one practice
    since sustaining the\ninjury, but the Chargers kept him in the lineup by providing
    pain-killing\nshots to the ankle on Sunday.\n\nJones, who could not be reached
    for comment, has not missed a game since his\nrookie year in 1997. He had started
    53 straight games before the Chargers\nopened with a tight end-less formation
    against Denver on Oct. 21.\n\nBut spread formations were not the reason Jones
    didn't start in two of the\npast three games; the ankle was. Last week in particular,
    the Chargers tried\nto limit him to two-tight end sets and occasional spread formations.
    The\nhope was that they could limit the wear and tear on him while still getting\nthe
    big play, such as two weeks ago when Jones caught a fourth-quarter\ntouchdown
    pass against the Chiefs. His three scoring receptions are tied for\nthe team lead
    with Conway.\n\nBut it has gotten to the point that Jones' condition was worsening
    instead\nof improving. Some close to him fear the injury could become chronic
    and\narthritic if Jones doesn't treat it properly now. Which means rest and\nrehab
    -- especially on Sunday.\n\nGeneral manager John Butler said late yesterday afternoon
    that he had yet to\nreceive word on Jones' status.\n\n\"Anytime someone wants
    a second opinion, he's sure welcome to it,\" Butler\nsaid. \"What else can you
    do? I don't know what the second opinion is going\nto show. Our doctors have done
    their work.\n\n\"You're always concerned when somebody's not feeling their best,
    so we'll\nsee if there's something detected that our people didn't see.\"\n\n\n[
    [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [  OUR VIEW  ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ]\n\n\nClearly
    bad news for Jones and also for Doug Flutie.   San Diego isn't a\nreal high profile
    team so it's not talked about a lot but Jones is a guy\nthey'd love to be the
    primary focus.   When healthy, he's that good.   You'd\nhave to think Curtis Conway
    and Jeff Graham will see a little more action\nalthough Jones hasn't been much
    of a factor lately already.   Few people\nthink Steve Heiden is the answer there.
    \  You may be able to grab an\navailable TE in your league if some owners have
    slacked off.   San\nFrancisco's Eric Johnson is a guy we've liked for a while
    that's starting to\nemerge and might be around in smaller leagues.\n\nThanks to
    Footballguy Scott Hensell for pointing me to this one.\n\nJoe\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\nBryant

  body: ! "\nTitle: Monthly Gas Briefing: Another Fall Tradition \t\nURL(s):\t\n\nhttp://www.cera.com/eprofile?u=35&m=2802;\n\n\n***********************************************************************\n\nNATURAL
    GAS MARKET LOOKS FOR THE ARRIVAL OF WINTER\n\nNatural gas market participants
    are renewing the annual tradition of seizing on \neach weather forecast for hints
    of the onset of winter weather. Although these \njitters have led to higher early-November
    prices, the winter market looks to be \nwell supplied owing to the combination
    of milder weather, depressed demand, \nhigh storage levels, and ample production.
    December Henry Hub prices are \nexpected to average $2.70 per MMBtu.\n\n* US gas
    storage inventories are estimated to leveled off at 3,107 billion \ncubic feet
    (Bcf) by the end of October. Without harsher weather, the year-over-\nyear storage
    surplus should swell to over 770 Bcf by end-December.\n\n* December demand will
    be significantly lower than in 2000 due largely to the \nmilder weather expected
    this year. While some industrial demand will return due \nto lower gas prices,
    overall demand should be 11 percent lower than last year.\n\n\n**end**\n\nFollow

  body: ! "Entire story:\nhttp://sports.yahoo.com/nfl/news/ap/20011119/ap-colts-pathon.html\n\n\nINDIANAPOLIS
    (AP) -- The Indianapolis Colts will place wide receiver Jerome\nPathon on injured
    reserve Tuesday.\n\nTeam president Bill Polian said Monday night that Pathon will
    undergo\nsurgery ``sometime soon'' to repair a damaged ligament in his right foot.\n\nThe
    move will end Pathon's fourth NFL season. The Colts did not announce how\nthey
    would fill Pathon's roster spot.\n\nPathon sprained his right foot near the end
    of the third game of the season,\na 44-13 loss at New England. He aggravated the
    injury during warmups before\nthe Colts played Miami on Nov. 11. Polian said a
    further examination last\nweek revealed more damage to the foot.\n\nPathon earned
    the starting job opposite two-time Pro Bowl receiver Marvin\nHarrison, and was
    having the best season of his career. He set career highs\nfor receptions and
    receiving yards in each of the Colts' first two games,\nand was the team's leading
    receiver through three games.\n\nHe missed four games before returning against
    Miami.\n\nPathon tried to practice last Wednesday. But Polian said the receiver
    had a\nsetback before missing Sunday's game at New Orleans.\n\nPathon finishes
    the season with 24 receptions for 330 yards and two\ntouchdowns.\n\n\n[ [ [ [

    just keep on rollin' for Indy.   Terrence Wilkins and Reggie\nWayne should benefit
    as should TE Marcus Pollard.   Tough break for Pathon\nwho was having a great
    start.\n\nThanks to Footballguy Chuck Bailey for pointing me to this one.\n\nJoe\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\n\nBryant

  subject: ! '[Footballguys] Breaking News - Fred Taylor Told to Stay Out Of Lineup'
  body: ! "Entire story:\nhttp://www.sportsline.com/u/ce/multi/0,1329,4560008_59,00.html\n\nClipped
    from the Jay Glazer article on CBS Sportsline:\n\nOne week after Miami-based specialist
    Dr. John Uribe recommended that Colts'\nrunning back Edgerrin James undergo season-ending
    knee surgery, the doctor\nrecommended that another star back is not yet ready
    to return to action.\n\nSportsLine.com has learned that Jaguars running back Fred
    Taylor met with\nthe specialist Tuesday morning and was told that his injured
    groin is still\nnot healed. Taylor has been practicing the past three weeks and
    the Jaguars\nhad hoped he would have been back in the lineup already. However,
    he has\nbeen unable to run full speed and now comes word that he will continue
    be\nsidelined.\n\n\"Dr. Uribe said he has a major injury and that after eight
    weeks, it's still\nnot healed and is going to take some more time getting healthy,\"
    Taylor's\nagent Drew Rosenhaus said. \"He wasn't sure specifically how much time
    Fred\nwould miss but it's a major tear, he tore the groin muscle off the bone.
    Dr.\nUribe said this is the type of injury that could often take a minimum of\nthree
    months before it is healed.\"\n\nTaylor injured the groin in the first half of
    the team's second game of the\nyear. He made a cut in the middle of the field
    and suddenly stopped, let go\nof the ball and dropped.\n\n\"It's going to be very
    unfair for anyone to assume he will play any time in\nthe immediate future,\"
    said Rosenhaus. \"He's just not healthy yet. He can't\nrun full speed without
    tremendous pain. The Jaguars have done a very good\njob in working him but he's
    still in pain.\n\n\"It's not just the groin but he also has pain in the hip now,
    which is an\noff-shoot of the groin. But he's still healing and he shouldn't play
    at this\ntime and when the Jaguars talk to him later today, I'm sure they'll have
    the\nsame feeling.\"\n\nIn Taylor's absence, the Jaguars have played musical chairs
    in the\nbackfield. Stacey Mack has been the primary replacement, but youngsters\nFrank
    Moreau and Elvis Joseph have also been given shots. Mack started\nSunday's game
    and will likely remain with the first team in the immediate\nfuture.\n\n\"He's
    doing everything he can to get back in as soon as possible,\" said the\nFlorida-based
    agent. \"Remember, we entered the season primed to play and\nreceive a big contract
    extension so nobody wants in there more than Fred.\n\n\"But the doctor recommends
    that he is progressing at a good pace and it\ndepends on how the injury heals.
    He said he has seen guys miss an entire\nseason with this. But at the same time,
    it's such a vague injury. Fred may\nwake up next week and suddenly feel great.
    At the same time, it could take\nseveral weeks. We don't know. We only know he's
    healing but shouldn't play\nat this time.\"\n\n\n[ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [  OUR
    VIEW  ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ]\n\n\nThis makes sense as the Jaguars have
    been very vague about Taylor's health.\nClearly, bad news for Taylor owners.   Stacey
    Mack and Elvis Joseph get an\nextension but they've come up pretty small so far.
    \  As Dr. Coshal, our\nFootballguys.com Team Doc mentioned way back when Taylor
    was injured, this\nis a serious deal.   Stay tuned but for now it's not looking
    good.\n\nThanks to Footballguy Jeff White for pointing me to this one.\n\nJoe\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\nBryant

    FACE=\"Arial, Helvetica\"><FONT SIZE=2>Boston has become one of the premier wide

    Helvetica\"><FONT SIZE=2>\nPatriots Head Coach Bill Belichick announced late Monday
    that Brady will remain the starting quarterback for the remainder of the season,
    barring injury. This relegates Drew Bledsoe to a backup role and makes him useless
    from a Fantasy perspective. Brady might have his hands full passing against the
    Saints on Sunday, but he is a fairly safe weekly starter otherwise.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A

    the remainder of the season due to a fragmented disc in his back. He will miss
    at least one month to rest and rehabilitate the injury before being re-evaluated.
    Gardener's absence hurts the Dolphins' rush defense, which might be burned a little
    more by opposing running backs in the upcoming weeks.</FONT></FONT><!\nBR!\n><BR><A

    FACE=\"Arial, Helvetica\"><FONT SIZE=2>Minnis is unlikely to be available for
    Sunday's game against Seattle due to the sprained ankle he suffered during a Nov.
    11 game against the Jets. He will be replaced by Chris Thomas in the lineup at
    split end, and you should keep him reserved for this week.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A

    FACE=\"Arial, Helvetica\"><FONT SIZE=2>\nBrunell's nagging leg injury might sideline
    him for Sunday's game against Baltimore. He decided about two hours before last
    Sunday's kickoff that he couldn't play against Pittsburgh due to a strained right
    quadriceps. Jonathan Quinn has been preparing as if he will start the game, so
    right now you shouldn't count on Brunell this week as you set your lineups.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A

    FACE=\"Arial, Helvetica\"><FONT SIZE=2>Taylor received a second medical opinion
    Tuesday that indicated his severe groin injury could keep him out up to three
    months and possibly the remainder of the season, according to the <I>Florida Times-Union</I>.
    The diagnosis was that the injury still has not healed and will need more time
    to become healthy, and in the meantime Taylor has developed pain in!\n h!\nis
    hip, a side effect of the injury. It's sounding more and more like Taylor will
    not play again this Fantasy season, although you should probably hold onto him
    until a final decision is reached, provided you have a deep enough bench.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A

    Helvetica\"><FONT SIZE=2>Smith's sprained ankle was not healed enough for him
    to practice on Tuesday, and there is a real chance he might miss Thursday's game
    against Dallas. He suffered the injury Nov. 11, and aggravated it during Sunday's
    game. You should probably play it safe and keep Smith on your bench for this week.
    Temper your expectations for the entire Broncos' offense as well - the Cowboys'
    D isn't the pushover many believed it would be prior to the season.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR>\n<A

  body: ! "\nAs you know, this is an unprecedented time in Enron's history.  We must
    adapt our employee programs to fit the immediate needs of our company during this
    time of transition.  It is especially difficult to announce the immediate suspension
    of the following programs.\n\n?\tClickAtHome - Enron has suspended the ClickAtHome
    program.  The program will no longer accept new participants, PC orders, or Internet
    service orders.  Orders submitted and confirmed prior to November 20, 2001 will
    be honored.  Enron will also discontinue subsidized Internet service.  Effective
    January 1, 2002, employees who are currently subscribers to subsidized Internet
    service will be switched to the regular commercial rate of their service provider
    and be responsible for the entire cost of the service.\n?\tMatching Gifts and
    Volunteer Incentive Program (VIP) - Enron's Matching Gift program and VIP grants
    have been suspended indefinitely.  As we consider the immediate needs of all employees
    during this trying time, it is appropriate that we discontinue the dollar for
    dollar match for charitable contributions as well as cash donations recognizing
    employees' volunteer hours with non-profit organizations.  Matching Gift or VIP
    submissions received prior to November 20 will be honored.\n\nWe regret that we
    have had to make these changes.  We must continue to look for ways to reduce operating
    expenses through this transition period.\n  "

  subject: ! '[Footballguys] Pittman Correction - Happy Thanksgiving - Joke'
  body: ! "Quick note for you Pittman owners I may have worried with my comment about\nThomas
    Jones scoring the Goalline TD.\n\nI'd forgotten my buddy Jim from Arizona had
    told me this:   Michael Pittman\nwears contact lenses and had a problem with one
    of his contacts at the\ngoalline so Jones came in.   If Pittman had not had the
    problem, he would\nhave likely gotten the score that Jones did.  (Hope none of
    you Pittman\nowners lost by a TD last week...)\n\nThanks Jim for keeping me straight.\n\nActually,
    I'm using that goof as a chance for David and I, along with the\nFootballguys.com
    staff, to wish you a very Happy Thanksgiving.   It's a\nalways a time for reflecting
    on the things we're thankful for and I know\nI've got more than I can count.   Hope
    you do too.   Have a great day and\ntravel safely if you're going anywhere.\n\nAnd
    not to beat up on our Detroit faithful (and I know there are LOT of you\nguys),
    but thought I'd share this one with you if you haven't heard it.\nDavid sent to
    me this morning:\n\nThere is a mama lion, a daddy lion & a baby lion.  The mama
    lion & the daddy\nlion were having a lot of fights so they decided to get a divorce.\n\nThe
    lion family goes in front of a judge to decide custody of the baby lion.\nThe
    judge asks the baby lion \"Do you wanna live with mama lion?\"   The baby\nlion
    answers \"No mama lion beats me.\"  The judge said \"All right, do you\nwanna
    live with daddy lion?\"  The baby lion answers \"No daddy lion beats me\nworse.\"\n\nThe
    judge asks \"who do you wanna live with then?\"\n\nThe baby answers  \"The Detroit
    Lions.  They don't beat anybody...\"\n\nHave a great weekend all.   Cheatsheets

    Briefing
  body: ! "\nTitle: Monthly Gas Briefing: A Shift Toward Winter \t\nURL(s):\t\n\nhttp://www20.cera.com/eprofile?u=35&m=2748;\n\n\n***********************************************************************\n\nNATURAL
    GAS PRICES REBOUND AS HEATING SEASON APPROACHES\n\nDespite high storage levels,
    with heating season coming, the Henry Hub cash \nmarket has bounced back from
    early October lows to levels near $2.40 per MMBtu. \nHowever, weak market fundamentals,
    including a sluggish economy and increased \nUS and Canadian supplies, will mitigate
    the usual winter price rise. CERA \nexpects an average Henry Hub price of $2.35
    in November.\n\n*  Although inventories are close to record levels, storage pressures
    are \nincreasingly unlikely to drive cash markets down significantly this year.
    \n\n*  Gas demand will average 14 percent lower than a year earlier; residential
    \nand commercial sectors show a decline with a return to normal weather, while
    a \nweak economy offsets the return of ammonia and dual-fuel loads in the \nindustrial
    sector.\n\n*  Regional storage inventories and weak regional demand should keep
    upward \npressure off of regional differentials. The Northeast examines security
    issues \naround LNG shipments.\n\n**end**\n\nFollow above URL for complete report

  subject: ! '[Footballguys] BREAKING NEWS - Tom Brady to Remain Starter'
  body: ! "Entire story:\nhttp://www.boston.com/dailyglobe2/324/sports/Is_Brady_the_1_+.shtml\n\nClipped
    from the Michael Smith article:   FOXBOROUGH - Bill Belichick said\nyesterday
    morning that Tom Brady will start at quarterback Sunday against\nNew Orleans,
    then took it a step further in the afternoon, saying Brady will\nstart Patriots
    games unless something drastic occurs.\n\n''I think as we move forward here, unless
    something unforeseen happens that\nTom will be the quarterback, and he'll get
    the snaps in practice and in the\ngames,'' Belichick said on the ''Patriots Monday''
    show on WWZN 1510.\n\nYesterday morning Belichick told the media at Foxboro Stadium,
    ''I don't see\nany changes this week. I don't think this is the time to get into
    a big\npersonnel evaluation, but I don't see any changes.'' Those comments came\nless
    than 12 hours afte his team's 24-17 loos to the St. Louis Rams.\n\nAt the news
    conference, Belichick was brief with his responses regarding the\nquarterback
    situation, but his comments to Sean McDonough on his weekly\nradio show on WWZN
    gave the indication that Brady will be his starter for\nthe forseeable future.\n\nThat
    decision likely would not sit well with Drew Bledsoe, a nine-year\nveteran and
    three-time Pro Bowler. Bledsoe sustained a sheared blood vessel\nafter a fierce
    hit by New York Jets linebacker Mo Lewis in Week 2, which\nopened the way for
    Brady to start the next eight games. Brady has led the\nPatriots to a 5-3 mark.\n\n''Drew
    hasn't been able to play the last eight weeks ... and Tom's more\ngame-ready at
    this point,'' Belichick said on the radio. ''That's the way\nwe're going to go.''\n\nBelichick
    reportedly informed the players of his plans last night during the\nweekly quarterbacks
    meeting. Patriots spokesman Stacey James confirmed only\nthat the meeting had
    taken place. Normally, it is held on Tuesday night, but\nthis week's schedule
    gives the players a day off for Thanksgiving, so it was\nmoved up.\n\nAttempts
    to reach Belichick, Brady, and Bledsoe last night were\nunsuccessful.\n\nBefore
    this season, Bledsoe signed the largest contract in NFL history,\nworth $103 million
    over 10 years. His compensation for this year alone is\n$11.5 million.\n\nBledsoe
    was activated for the Rams game - for the first time since his\ninjury - but watched
    as Brady threw two costly interceptions before bringing\nthe Patriots within a
    touchdown with a 10-yard scoring pass to David Patten\nwith 7:46 left.\n\nThe
    first interception was a strike to Kevin Faulk early in the first\nquarter that
    bounced off the running back's shoulder pads. Dexter McCleon\nwas there to make
    the pick, and the Rams scored the game's first touchdown\nthree plays later.\n\n\n[
    [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [  OUR VIEW  ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ]\n\n\nYou Brady
    owners can rest a little easier as it looks like he could be the\nman.   Nothing
    with Bill Belichick is ever set in stone so I wouldn't get\ntoo comfortable but
    obviously, this is good news for you Brady folks or\nthose looking to snag him
    for the homestretch run.\n\nThanks to Footballguy Eric Posty for sending this
    one to me.\n\nJoe\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\nBryant

    You'll get the chance \nto be heard by thousands of Fantasy players just like
    \nyourself! \n\n\nMarcus Howell: Who would you start in Week 11: Brian Griese
    \nat Dallas or Jake Plummer at San Diego?\n\nG.G. - Griese's receiving corps has
    been crippled by injuries \nthis season, and with Rod Smith questionable with
    an ankle \ninjury, the outlook gets dimmer. The Denver QB has been \nbothered
    by physical problems this year as well. Plummer \nseems like a better choice after
    a superb Week 10 outing. But \nremember that he was facing the 0-9 Lions, and
    Plummer has \nnever been able to string many good performances together in \nthe
    past. He will be facing a San Diego defense that will be \nprimed for a good performance
    after getting burned badly by \nOakland last week. Go with Griese, who should
    at least post \nrespectable numbers at Dallas.\n\nEric Fernau: Which three running
    backs should I start?  I \nhave Corey Dillon, Ricky Williams, Duce Staley, Priest
    \nHolmes and Garrison Hearst.\n\nG.G. - Dillon is a must-start player every week.
    Holmes is \nfacing a Seattle defense that looks good statistically, but \nwill
    have a lot of trouble containing him on the outside. \nStaley should have little
    trouble ripping through the \nWashington front wall. It's hard to ignore Hearst
    at \nIndianapolis or Williams in any week, but we like Dillon, \nHolmes and Staley,
    especially the latter in an NFC East game.\n\nJay Rassat: Who do I start this
    week at quarterback? I have \nTom Brady, Aaron Brooks and Trent Green. The defenses
    they \nplay against are all decent (N.O., N.E. and Seattle).\n\nG.G. - Brady and
    Brooks square off against each other, and \neach is facing a secondary that can
    give up the big play. \nGreen will be facing a Seattle team that won't offer much
    of \na pass rush, but he is less explosive than Brooks or Brady. \nWith Brady
    having the advantage of playing at home, and Drew \nBledsoe looking over his shoulder,
    we'll go with the New \nEngland QB.\n\n\nFANTASY FOOTBALL GUIDES\n\nWant to win

    \n\n\nTIP OF THE WEEK\n\nRyan Carter, Watertown, CT: Ricky Watters' decision to
    not \nhave shoulder surgery is bad news for him, but great news for \npeople like
    me, who have Shaun Alexander. I would not be \nsurprised to see Watters not play
    again this year. Ricky's a \ngreat back, and I wish him well, but you cannot replace
    a \nback like Alexander.\n\n\nSPORTING NEWS\n\nAttention Fantasy Fans! Subscribe

    the 0-9 Lions, and Plummer has \nnever been able to string many good performances
    together in \nthe past. He will be facing a San Diego defense that will be \nprimed
    for a good performance after getting burned badly by \nOakland last week. Go with

    props are usually available and can greatly add to the overall atmosphere and
    theme of your picture. This is an especially nice touch for holiday photography
    - for example, the inclusion of the pumpkin pie in the image above strengthens
    the concept of a festive family feast, and enhances the photo's sense of fun and
    whimsy.</span>\n<br>\n\n<br>\n<span class=\"line\"><b>Time to Reflect?</b><br></span>\n<img

    width=\"163\" height=\"126\" vspace=\"5\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\">\n<span class=\"line\">Always
    be aware of your reflection or shadow in the picture. Sometimes it's a distraction,
    and sometimes it adds greatly to the image. You may recall the famous shot of
    astronaut Buzz Aldrin in full space walking garb complete with reflection of fellow
    astronaut and photographer Neil Armstrong. (Photo Credit: NASA)</span>\n<br>\n\n<br>\n<span

    width=\"163\" height=\"126\" vspace=\"5\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\">\n<span class=\"line\">If
    you're shooting on an overcast day, wait for the sun to dart through the clouds.
    According to meteorologists, this happens, on average, in spurts every two to
    three minutes. You typically get a thirty-second opportunity for a more interesting
    and illuminated image.<br></span>\n<br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"line\"><b>Member
    Suggestion (NEW!)</b><br>\nIf you don't want to invest in, or carry a large flash
    diffuser for steady shots, try using a 'space blanket' instead (available at most
    camping stores). They're lightweight and very inexpensive, and the reflective
    Mylar surface is perfect for bouncing a light source on to your subject. - Jim

  body: ! 'The potential use of biological agents such as Anthrax in a terrorist attack
    continues to raise concerns worldwide.  Here at Enron, the mail center and Business
    Controls/Corporate Security have already implemented safeguards so that all mail
    entering the Enron buildings will be screened in accordance with procedures for
    identifying suspicious packages.  We are also in touch with the U.S. Postal Service
    and the Centers for Disease Control to ensure we have the most complete and up-to-date
    guidance for handling any possible Anthrax exposures.


    However, should you receive an envelope or package that you do not feel comfortable
    opening, please contact Corporate Security at extension 3-6200 and we will screen
    it again.


    To provide Enron employees with a better understanding of  Anthrax and the potential
    danger it poses, we have posted a bulletin on the Corporate Security intranet
    site http://home.enron.com:84/security/002_bull_001.html that includes links to

  subject: DJ ICEY and KIMBALL COLLINS THIS FRIDAY!
  body: ! "NOVEMBER 23rd\nDJ ICEY and\nKIMBALL COLLINS\n\nflyer  located here:\nhttp://clubhyperia.com/weekly/iceykimball.htm\n\n\nDJ
    Icey\nLurking in the shadows of Florida's burgeoning dame music community is a
    low-key musical visionary named DJ lcey. By day he runs his Zone Records indie,
    when the sun sets he regularly decimates dancefloors at clubs and raves all across
    America courtesy, of his crafty mixing manner. For the past seven years, DJ Icey
    has carefully avoided the, scrutiny and excesses of the spotlight, and has focused
    his energies on pioneering funky breaks, an energetic hybrid which incorporates
    booming hip-hop beats with an uptempo house sensibility and lots of bass in-your-face.
    \"I'm basically a shy person,\" says Icey, \"and I prefer to express myself through
    my music or when I'm DJING for a packed dancefloor,\" \n\nWhile growing up in
    Florida, DJ Icey was always infatuated with music of all types. He passionately
    collected vinyl and loved anything with a synth hook and electro drum beat. Having
    few musical limitations, he fell in love with a disparate melange of groups: Scritti
    Polliti, Run-DMC, New Order, Cabaret Voltaire and Audio Two. Anything with just
    the right groove sooner or later found its way into his collection, and his tastes
    soon broadened to run the gamut of club music: hip-hop, acid house, Chicago house,
    Miami Bass and Latin freestyle. \n\nAfter getting his spinning career into full
    gear in Orlando, Icey went on to helm a legendary residency at the now defunct
    club, The Edge. Not only did he use that time to pioneer funky breaks and get
    his remix-production career going, he also made history by convincing the then
    unknown Chemical Brothers to play their first U.S. show on July 4, 1993 at The
    Edge. Upon the club's demise, Icey, hit the road xvit his crate of vinyl and hasn't
    looked back. Now regarded as the kind of funky breaks, he's won a legion of followers
    all across the country. And because of the eclectic nature of his sets, it's no
    wonder that on any given moment his dancefloor might be packed with break dancers,
    B-boys and househeads all losing their minds in unison. \n\nThat leads us to DJ
    Icey 14-track FFRR compilation, The Funky Breaks, which shows exactly why this
    mixmaster is tops on everyone's list. Not only does it portray his adept mixing
    technique, but it also pleasantly illustrates his playlist. Icey's association
    with FFRR dates back to when A&R man Nell Harris played a Zone Records 12\" of
    DJ Icey,s \"Big Ditch\" for FFRR kingpin Pete Tong. The duo were so taken with
    the track that they promptly licensed and re-released it adding \"Galaxo\" on
    the flip, later incorporating him into the Sunshine State Of Mind compilation,
    a well-received showcase of Florida's top dance producers. \n\nThe unpredictability
    of The Funky Breaks is clearly evident with DJ Icey throwing everything from his
    own \"Grand Canyon Suite\" and\"Beats-a Rockin\"' to PM Dawn's \"A Watcher's Point
    Of View\" and Armand Van Helden's remix of Genaside Its' \"Narra Mine.\" \"I like
    to play with a lot of energy, and what you hear on The Funky Breaks is a good
    taste of -what I'm like when I spin,\" says Icey, who has also remixed the likes
    of Deee-Lite, Faith No More, Two Bad Mice, and A-Town Players. \"There's a lot
    of obscure tracks, such as the Ride Conunittee featuring Roxy's 'Get Huh' which
    has been a favorite of mine for a long time. I guess that I don't like to play
    a predictable set and this mix represents that.\" \n\nDJ lcey: he's always as
    funky as he wants to be. \n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nKimball
    Collins is a renown Trance and House music DJ who has received global recognition
    for his unique style of DJ-ing and producing. \n\nKimball, who was raised in Orlando,
    Florida, started his DJ career in 1987 and since he has become one of the most
    respected and sought after House and Trance music DJ?s in the US.  After being
    the resident DJ for over five years at the now legendary Beacham Theater, which
    rose to prominence between 1989 and 1994, Kimball became the leading figure and
    probably the most talked about person in the Florida dance music scene. Kimball
    was a true originator of the house music movement in the southern region of America

  subject: Update From American Airlines
  body: ! "Dear Martin Cuilla,\n\nI promised to keep you informed and wanted to provide
    an update on the\nsituation surrounding Flight 587. The National Transportation
    Safety\nBoard investigation is still underway, with both the cockpit voice and\nflight
    data recorders being analyzed for clues about the cause of the\naccident.\n\nIn
    addition to our normal aircraft inspection program, and as purely a\nprecautionary
    measure, we have begun a voluntary inspection of all tail\nfins on the Airbus
    A300 fleet.  The inspection process started on\nThursday and should be concluded
    next week. We have completed\napproximately 25% of the inspections. While we don't
    anticipate any\nproblems, we certainly want to look at any and all possibilities
    for\nthe accident's cause.  When the inspection is finished we will\ncommunicate
    those results.\n\nOn behalf of all of us at American Airlines, I want to thank
    everyone\nfor the outpouring of support we've received following Monday's\ntragedy.
    We are heartened by the many notes of care and concern. The\nunprecedented actions
    over the past 60 days have tested the entire\nnation in a way that could not be
    envisioned prior to September 11. \n\nI hope that you find these communications
    informative. It is my pledge\nto you to keep you informed of not only issues surrounding
    the accident\nbut also security and airport process measures that we are implementing\nacross
    our system.\n\nOn behalf of the 100,000 employees at American, TWA and American
    Eagle,\nthanks for your support.\n\nSincerely, \n\nMike Gunn\nExecutive Vice President\nAmerican
    Airlines\n\n\n\n* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *\nSubscribe

  subject: ! '[Footballguys] BREAKING NEWS - Emmitt Smith to Play "Majority of Game"'
  body: ! "Entire story:\nhttp://cbs.sportsline.com/u/wire/stories/0,1169,4534966_59,00.html\n\n\nIRVING,
    Texas (AP) Emmitt Smith will return to the Dallas Cowboys' lineup\nSunday against
    Philadelphia after missing two games with a sprained right\nknee.\n\nCoach Dave
    Campo said after practice Friday that Smith would \"be ready to\nplay the majority
    of the game.\"\n\nSmith returned to practice Thursday and was back on the field
    Friday. He was\nhurt during the Cowboys' 17-3 win over Arizona on Oct. 28 when
    he was\ntackled after a 1-yard gain in the final two minutes.\n\nSmith, the NFL's
    second-leading career rusher, did not speak with reporters.\n\nBefore missing
    consecutive games for the first time in his 12-year NFL\ncareer, Smith had missed
    only two other games because of injury - one in\n1994 and another five years later.\n\nSmith
    has 15,564 career yards rushing, 1,162 behind Walter Payton's NFL\nrecord.\n\nTroy
    Hambrick, who rushed for 204 yards while replacing Smith in losses to\nthe New
    York Giants and Atlanta, will start at fullback.\n\n\n[ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [
    [  OUR VIEW  ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ]\n\n\nDoesn't make a lot of sense
    to me with Hambrick playing the way he does but\nfar be it from me to try and
    figure out Jerry Jones.   Emmitt has paid the\ndues and has earned the start I
    suppose when he's healthy.   Bottom line is\nput a heavy downgrade on Hambrick
    for now.\n\nJoe\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\nBryant

  body: ! "As we passed along to you yesterday, ESPNews was reporting that Olandis
    Gary\nmight get the starting nod for this weeks game.   It was reported in several\nplaces,
    including CBS Sportsline.\n\nNow CBS Sportsline is offering this\nhttp://football0.commissioner.com/mp/pro-home?league=zero
    \ :   \"Contrary to\nsome earlier reports, Anderson will remain the starter in
    Denver's backfield\nfor now. Some reports had indicated that Olandis Gary would
    start in his\nplace.\"\n\nThis seems to be consistent with what the local Denver
    press is saying as\nwell.\n\nClearly, nothing is for certain with a Mike Shanahan
    Running Back Corps but\nfor now, it looks like Anderson is back as the starter
    although I wouldn't\nbe surprised to see Gary see some carries as well.\n\nThanks
    to Footballguy Bob Harris for sending me the email on this one which\nhe entitled
    \"the truth shall set you free\"...\n\nJoe\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\nBryant

  body: ! "For any of you with early lineup deadlines:\n\nESPNews is reporting that
    Olandis Gary could get the starting nod at RB for\nDenver.\n\n\n[ [ [ [ [ [ [
    [ [ [ [ [ [  OUR VIEW  ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ]\n\n\nWelcome to Shannyland...\n\nTerrell
    Davis caught 5 passes last week and this could be an area where Mike\nShanahan
    wants to use Gary.   It's logical that both could see time until\nTerrell Davis
    is ready.   Or I wouldn't be surprised to see Anderson get all\nthe carries.   Sadly,
    I wouldn't be surprised to see Gary get all the\ncarries.   It's a murky deal
    there right now.   Unless it clears up pretty\nfast, I'd probably avoid.\n\nJoe\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\nBryant

  subject: ! '[Footballguys] BREAKING NEWS - Edgerrin James 2nd Opinion No Better
    Than 1st'
  body: ! "Entire story:   http://espn.go.com/nfl/news/2001/1115/1278717.html\n\nKnee
    Injury Sidelines James for Rest of Season\n\nThe second opinion sought by Edgerrin
    James on his damaged left knee, and\nobtained in the last few days, has confirmed
    the worst -- the Indianapolis\nColts star tailback is out for the remainder of
    the season.\n\nESPN.com has learned through various league sources, including
    several close\nto the two-time league rushing champion, that James has been apprised
    he\nwill require surgery to repair a torn anterior cruciate ligament.\n\nThat
    determination was made by noted South Florida orthopedic surgeon John\nUribe,
    the second specialist to examine James' knee. James, who was injured\nin an Oct.
    28 game at Kansas City, has missed Indianapolis' last two games.\n\nESPN's Chris
    Mortensen first reported Monday that James was likely out for\nthe year.\n\nThe
    team's first-round pick in the 1999 draft, James, 23, had played in 38\nconsecutive
    games until the injury.\n\nWhile club officials continue to concede only that
    James will miss the next\n2-3 weeks and suggested reports he is lost for the rest
    of the season are\npremature, the tailback has told several teammates his 2001
    campaign is\nover.\n\nAlthough the timing could change, James tentatively plans
    to confirm the\ninjury and announce details of the surgery and for his subsequent\nrehabilitation
    at a press conference next Tuesday.\n\nA date for the surgery, which will be performed
    by Dr. Uribe, has not yet\nbeen set. But the rehabilitation period is expected
    to be 6-8 months and\ncould mean that James will not be totally rehabilitated
    in time for the\nstart of training camp next summer.\n\nJames is familiar with
    Uribe, the team doctor at the University of Miami,\nwhere the Colts tailback played
    collegiately, and apparently has great faith\nin his judgment.\n\nThe fourth overall
    player selected in the '99 draft, James led the league in\nrushing as a rookie
    (1,553 yards) and then again for the 2000 season (1,709\nyards). His total of
    3,262 yards is the second-most ever by a player in the\nfirst two seasons of his
    career.\n\n\n[ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [  OUR VIEW  ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ]
    ] ]\n\n\nConfirms what we reported to you earlier from ESPN's Chris Mortensen.\n\nHere's
    what Bill Polian said after it was first reported James was done for\nthe season
    three days ago:  \"So I turned my computer on. I read the report\non ESPN and
    I just kind of chuckled. I don't know where they get this\ninformation.   \"It
    (the report) is a lot of uninformed speculation from\npeople who are uninformed,\"\n\nEvidently,
    we weren't as uninformed as he thought...\n\nWhat this means for you is that Dominic
    Rhodes has a chance to shine.   He's\ngot a nicked shoulder but is reportedly
    set to play this weekend and will be\nlooking to make the most of his opportunity.
    \  Keep a close eye on this one.\n\nThanks to Footballguy Joe Profaizer for pointing
    me to this one.\n\nJoe\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\n\nBryant

  subject: ! '[Footballguys] Breaking News - Vikings Woes - Bennett and Moss'
  body: ! "Hi Folks,\n\nFor you guys who own Randy Moss or Michael Bennett (or those
    who feel like\ntaunting the Moss / Bennett owners in your league...) here's the
    latest from\nthe Star Tribune in Minnesota:   (and yes, when I say \"guys\", I
    mean you\ngirls too so please spare me the avalanche of email I always get whenever
    I\nsay \"guys\".   Laughing)\n\nJoe\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\nVikings'
    Bennett Will Miss Game, Moss' Play Will Be Limited\n\nEntire Story:  http://www.startribune.com/stories/503/760564.html\n\nClipped
    from the Kevin Seifert article published online 10-16-01:\n\nAn offense based
    on speed might have to get by on guile this week. The\nVikings' two fastest players
    are questionable for Sunday's game against the\nGreen Bay Packers, and one of
    them almost certainly will not play.\n\nReceiver Randy Moss and tailback Michael
    Bennett are both suffering from\nsprained right ankles, and while Moss likely
    will play at limited capacity,\nBennett is expected sit out Sunday. The revelation
    of Moss' injury coincided\nwith his least productive start in four NFL seasons,
    while Bennett's ailment\nwill allow him to quietly step back from his own disappointing
    start and\ngive way to Doug Chapman.\n\n\"I think Randy will be able to play,\"
    Vikings coach Dennis Green said\nMonday. \"I don't think there is any doubt about
    that. Michael will probably\nnot be able to play.\"\n\nMoss seemed less confident
    of that certainty, however. The ankle, which he\noriginally sprained playing basketball
    prior to minicamp in 1998, began\nthrobbing during Sunday's 31-26 victory over
    the Detroit Lions.\n\nGreen and members of the Vikings' medical staff characterized
    the pain as\nresidual affects from the 1998 injury, a condition he will continue
    to have\nthe rest of his career. But Moss woke up Monday morning with more stiffness\nand
    soreness than ever, according to trainer Chuck Barta.\n\nAs he departed Winter
    Park, Moss said the ankle \"is fine, man. It's fine.\"\nBut asked if there was
    no doubt he would play Sunday, Moss only shrugged his\nshoulders. It would behoove
    him to try; Moss has caught passes for at least\n100 yards in five of his six
    games against the Packers, and has more\nreceiving yards against them (753) than
    any other team.\n\nBennett, who cut off interviews with local media last week,
    declined to\ncomment Monday. The No. 1 draft choice has struggled to replace Robert
    Smith\nas the Vikings' featured running back, rushing for 214 yards and a 3.5\nyards-per-carry
    average while failing to score a touchdown in five games.\n\nThe Vikings also
    have been disappointed in his ability to pick up blitzes in\npass protection.
    While Chapman does not represent a clear improvement in\nthat area, some in the
    organization believe Bennett might benefit from a\nweek or two on the sideline.
    He was limping noticeably Monday at Winter Park\nwhile wearing an immobilizing
    boot.\n\nAssuming the Vikings rule Bennett out for Sunday, Green said Chapman
    would\nstart and Travis Prentice would begin assuming more of a short-yardage
    role.\nHarold Morrow would serve as a third tailback.\n\nChapman, who has rushed
    11 times for 38 yards in limited playing time this\nseason, said he would be ready.\n\n\"It's
    not music to my ears when somebody gets injured, but this is the NFL,\"\nChapman
    said. \"I'm more than capable. I'm just going to go out and do what I\nhave to
    do.\"\n\nOf greater concern, is Moss' condition. He has caught 21 passes for 321\nyards
    and one touchdown in five games this season; his second-lowest output\nfor the
    first five games of a season came in 1999, when he caught 21 passes\nfor 365 yards
    and three touchdowns.\n\nMoss had an uncharacteristically sloppy game Sunday against
    the Lions,\ndropping two passes and allowing a third to go through his arms and
    into the\nhands of Lions cornerback Todd Lyght for an interception. He mistimed
    his\njump on several other occasions, a mistake Green attributed to the injury,\nand
    Moss removed himself from the game liberally to catch his breath.\n\n\"Randy Moss
    doesn't normally drop passes,\" Green said. \"One thing you can\nalways tell,
    if a guy is hurt, his concentration level is not there. It's\nvery difficult to
    play at your best if you are not 100 percent health-wise.\nI think that was clearly
    the case yesterday with Randy, so we're going to do\neverything we can to get
    him as close to possible to 100 percent.\"\n\nMoss has never missed a game since
    joining the Vikings, playing in all 53\nregular season and six postseason games.
    He declined an invitation to the\n2001 Pro Bowl after bruising several ribs during
    the NFC Championship Game,\nbut Green lauded Moss' tolerance for pain. Moss will
    undergo round-the-clock\nrehabilitation this week, and Green said he should know
    by Thursday how much\nMoss will be able to play.\n\nWithout Moss at his best and
    without Bennett at all, the Vikings will be\nmissing two of their top speedsters
    against the Packers. Their injuries will\nplace an even greater emphasis on the
    performance of quarterback Daunte\nCulpepper, who rushed for a career-high 83
    yards Sunday while also playing a\nnear error-free game.\n\n\"We prefer to have
    our total speed out there, but we're a fast team\noverall,\" Green said. \"We're
    quick and explosive. It's not just because we\nhave Randy, because we have some
    other guys with some speed. So we will be\nable to operate. I think the best thing
    is that Daunte will get better every\ngame. He loves big games. I think he'll
    be ready to play a tremendous game\nand we'll depend on him to a certain extent
    to help operate our offense this\nweek.\"\n\n\n[ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [  OUR
    VIEW  ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ]\n\nClearly, bad news here.   You know we
    never got on the Bennett bandwagon but\nhe's been even worse than we expected.
    \  Chapman could make some noise but\nthe Travis Prentice issue is ugly.   Plus
    you have the best goalline \"back\"\nin the game with QB Daunte Culpepper.   For
    Moss, my guess based on what we\nknow now is that you have to start him and cross
    your fingers.   He's too\ngood to sit unless you have excellent options at WR.
    \  He can turn a game\n(and your weekend) around in a couple of plays.   I'd have
    to be blind to\nsay I wasn't seriously worried about him but I don't think I could
    sit him\nunless you're really deep there.\nMore as we hear it.\n\nThanks to our
    Footballguy Tony for pointing me to this one from our message\nboards  www.footballguystalk.com\n\nJoe\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\n\nBryant

  subject: Third Quarter Earnings Results
  body: ! "\nToday, we announced our third quarter earnings results, which were right
    on target with analysts estimates for recurring earnings per diluted share of
    $0.43.  This marks a 26 percent increase over the third quarter of last year,
    which is due to the strong performance of our core wholesale and retail energy
    businesses and our natural gas pipelines.  In addition, we also announced that
    we are on track for our earnings target of $0.45 for the fourth quarter ($1.80
    for 2001) and $2.15 for 2002.\n\nWe made a commitment to you that we would provide
    you with timely information about Enron's business strategy and performance, so
    this email is intended to provide an explanation about our earnings this quarter.\n\nOver
    the past few months, we have met with analysts to discuss Enron's performance.
    \ We received considerable feedback from investors and analysts that we needed
    to expand our financial reporting to include details for more of our business
    units.  In response to that feedback, we have provided results separately for
    several of our business units.  For example, while we have provided volume figures
    for North America and Europe, this is the first quarter we have provided financials
    separately for Enron Americas and for Europe and Other Commodities.  In addition,
    information about our global assets had previously been included in our numbers
    for Wholesale Services.  This quarter they are reported separately.   Finally,
    even though our broadband business is now part of Enron Wholesale Services, we
    are continuing to report that business separately.\n\nFollowing are the highlights
    of our businesses:\n\nWholesale Services: Total income before interest, minority
    interests and taxes (IBIT) increased 28% to $754 million in the third quarter.
    \ Total wholesale physical volumes increased 65% to 88.2 trillion British thermal
    units equivalent per day (Tbtue/d).\nAmericas: IBIT increased 31% to $701 million.
    \ Natural gas volumes increased 6% to 26.7 Tbtu/d, and power volumes increased
    77% to 290 million megawatt hours (MWh).\nEurope and Other Commodity Markets:
    IBIT remained unchanged at $53 million as compared to last year.  While physical
    gas and power volumes increased, low volatility in these markets caused profitability
    to remain flat.\n\nRetail Services: Enron Energy Services reported IBIT of $71
    million, compared to $27 million a year ago.  So far this year, EES has completed
    more than 50 transactions with large customers and more than 95,000 deals with
    small business customers.\n\n\nTransportation and Distribution:\n\tNatural Gas
    Pipelines: IBIT increased slightly to $85 million in the third quarter.\nPortland
    General: We reported an IBIT loss of $(17) million this quarter compared to IBIT
    of $74 million a year ago.  This loss is due to power contracts PGE entered into
    at prices that were significantly higher than actual settled prices during the
    third quarter.  Last week, we  announced an agreement to sell PGE to Northwest
    Natural.  This transaction is expected to close next year.\nGlobal Assets: This
    segment includes Elektro, Dabhol, TGS, Azurix and Enron Wind.  Third quarter IBIT
    remained unchanged at $19 million compared to last year.\n\nBroadband Services:
    IBIT losses were $(80) million in the current quarter compared to a $(20) million
    loss last year.  This quarter's results include significantly lower investment-related
    income and lower operating costs.\n\nCorporate and other: This segment includes
    the unallocated expenses associated with general corporate functions. This segment
    reported an IBIT loss of $(59) million compared to $(106) million a year ago.\n\nIn
    addition, this quarter we announced one-time charges of $1.01 billion.  Over the
    past few quarters, we have conducted a thorough  review of our businesses and
    have decided to take certain charges to clear away issues that have clouded the
    performance and earnings potential  of our core businesses.  These charges include:\n?\tA
    $287 million write-down of Azurix Corp.\n?\t$183 million associated with the restructuring
    of Broadband Services.  This includes severance costs, a loss on the sale of inventory
    like servers and routers, and a write-down of the value of our content services
    contracts due to the bankruptcy of a number of customers.\n?\t$544 million related
    to losses from certain investments, primarily Enron's interest in The New Power
    Company, broadband and technology investments and early termination of a structured
    finance arrangement.  \n\nWith our announcements this quarter we accomplished
    three things:  1) we showed continued strong earnings and earnings growth in our
    core businesses, 2) we cleared away those things that were clouding this superb
    performance in our core businesses, and 3) We expanded our reporting of financial
    results to increase transparency for our investors. To read the full earnings
    press release, go to www.enron.com/corp/pressroom/releases."

  body: ! "Entire story:   http://espn.go.com/nfl/news/2001/1123/1283244.html\n\n\nRookie
    Anthony Thomas, who has emerged as the Chicago Bears' top running\nback this season,
    may miss Sunday's NFC Central clash against the Minnesota\nVikings.\n\nThomas,
    who has 638 rushing yards and four touchdowns, has been downgraded\nto doubtful
    for Sunday's game with a strained right hamstring.\n\nJames Allen, a 1,000-yard
    rusher last season who lost his job to Thomas,\nlikely would start if Thomas is
    inactive for Sunday's game.\n\nThis is a crucial game for both teams. The Bears
    (7-2) need the victory to\nstay ahead of the Packers in the Central, and the Vikings
    (4-5) need the win\nsimply to stay in the hunt for a playoff spot.\n\n\n[ [ [
    [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [  OUR VIEW  ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ]\n\n\nIt's a dice
    roll here, folks.   He hasn't practiced all week and James Allen\nhas been working
    with the first team.   If you don't have anyone close to\nThomas' ability, you
    might roll the dice with him but if you've got another\noption, I'd probably go
    with the safer route.   From Coach Dick Jauron's\neyes, I'm guessing he sees Allen
    as not a horrible choice plus the fact he\nwants to get Allen healthy for the
    stretch run and playoffs.   Just my guess\nthough.\n\nJoe\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\n\nBryant

  subject: ! '[Footballguys] News Update - More On Anthony Thomas'
  body: ! "\nHi Folks,\n\nHere's the latest thing I know on Anthony Thomas from our
    good friend Bob\nHarris of the www.tflreport.com .   Thanks Bob and Happy Thanksgiving\nEveryone.\n\nJoe\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\nTHOMAS
    SKIPS PRACTICE TO REST SORE HAMSTRING...\nPosted Thursday November 22, 2001 @
    03:35 PT\n\n\nAccording to chicagobears.com senior writer Larry Mayer, Anthony
    Thomas sat\nout practice Wednesday with a strained right hamstring, but the Bears
    are\nhopeful the rookie running back will start Sunday night's game against the\nMinnesota
    Vikings at the Metrodome.\n\n\"We're concerned with him,\" head coach Dick Jauron
    admitted. \"He said he\nfelt better today than he felt yesterday. We'll monitor
    him right through\nthe week, but I don't think we're going to know anything really
    until close\nto the end of the week.\"\n\nJauron revealed that Thomas has been
    hampered by the nagging injury for a\nfew weeks. That would appear to explain
    the A-Train's recent decline in\nproduction. The second-round pick rushed for
    58 yards on 23 carries in last\nSunday's win at Tampa and 45 yards on 22 attempts
    a week earlier in a loss\nto Green Bay.\n\nIn his three previous outings, Thomas
    averaged 137 yards on 27 carries\nincluding a 188-yard performance in Cincinnati.
    That effort shattered a\n67-year-old team rookie record held by Beattie Feathers,
    who rushed for 155\nyards against Green Bay in 1934.\n\nThomas was named the NFL
    Rookie of the Month in October, but he hasn't\ndisplayed the same explosive burst
    since. He had seven runs of at least 16\nyards (46, 32, 23, 21, 19, 18, 16) in
    the first six games, but none longer\nthan 12 yards the last three weeks.\n\n\"He's
    not a guy who complains, but it's had to bother him and he's missed\npractice
    time, which is not good either,\" Jauron said. \"When you have a\nhamstring problem,
    you're going to feel it any time you try to accelerate at\nall.\n\n\"He felt OK
    today in terms of where he was a week ago, but not good enough\nto practice. We'll
    just have to see where that one goes.\"\n\nThomas said Wednesday that he's confident
    he'll play against the Vikings and\nfelt the hamstring problem was related to
    a sore left big toe that's\nbothered him most of the season. The toe is much improved,
    but he believes\nit contributed to the hamstring injury.\n\n\"Once you favor one
    thing and compensate for something else, there's always\ngoing to be something
    that's off-balance,\" Thomas said. \"I guess that's\nprobably one of the things
    that did it.\n\n\"My toe is coming around a lot better now. It's probably the
    best it ever\nfelt. Just from compensating, my leg's a little sore on the other
    side. But\nmy foot's doing real well.\"\n\nThomas said he planned to test the
    hamstring Thursday in practice. If he\nwere unable to play Sunday, James Allen
    would replace him. Thomas supplanted\nAllen as the starter after the rookie's
    188-yard outburst Oct. 21 in\nCincinnati. The performance was the eighth best
    in team history and the most\nprolific rushing day since the legendary Walter
    Payton had 192 yards on 28\ncarries on Nov. 3, 1985 at Green Bay.\n\nThomas ranks
    fifth in the NFC with 638 yards and 4 TDs on 150 carries (4.3\navg.), while Allen
    has rushed for 243 yards and 1 TD on 78 attempts (3.1).\nSince losing the starting
    job, Allen has carried just five times in four\ngames for 36 yards.\n\nDespite
    the limited action, the four-year veteran did contribute one of the\nbiggest plays
    of the season. He dove to catch a 34-yard Hail Mary TD pass\nfrom Shane Matthews
    on the final play of regulation in an eventual overtime\nwin over Cleveland Nov.
    4 at Soldier Field.\n\nIf Thomas is limited Sunday, Allen would relish the chance
    for more playing\ntime in what's the Bears' third of six straight divisional games.
    Last\nseason the Oklahoma product rushed for a career-high 1,120 yards and his
    290\ncarries were the second most by a Bear since Payton retired.\n\n\"I'm ready,\"
    Allen said. \"We have a lot riding on this game, just like we do\nweek-in and
    week-out. I just have to play my part, see how it goes, and stay\ninto it mentally.\n\n\"Just
    to help this team win, if it's 10 carries or 25 carries, I've got to\ndo my part.\"\n\nStay
    tuned. ... I'll have more on Thomas after today's practice.\n\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\n\nBryant

    from the John Mullin article:\n\nThe Bears are preparing to play one of the NFL's
    poorest defenses against\nthe run but may face that defense without their No.
    1 running back.\n\nRookie tailback Anthony Thomas is questionable with a strained
    hamstring\nthat has bothered him for the last couple of weeks, got a little worse
    in\nthe win over Tampa Bay and could eventually cause coaches to hold him out
    of\na game to let it heal.\n\nThomas did not practice Wednesday and his status
    for Sunday night's game at\nMinnesota will not be determined until closer to game
    time.\n\n\"I can't say when I really did it,\" Thomas said. \"It just bothered
    me a\nlittle more at the end and halftime when you rest on it awhile.\"\n\nInjuries
    are part of every week's preparations and players become accustomed\nto playing
    with pain and injury. But with a playoff berth possible, the\nBears may bench
    Thomas to let the hamstring get closer to full strength.\n\n\"We could get there,\"
    said coach Dick Jauron. \"You definitely don't want to\ndo that, but any player
    that's out there that has an injury that causes them\nto not only be not as effective
    as they can be but also risks further\ninjury, you don't want to expose him to
    that. We'll just have to monitor\nthat really closely.\"\n\n\n[ [ [ [ [ [ [ [

    \  Realize the Bears are thinking now much further past\njust this game.   Dick
    Jauron knows Anthony Thomas will be a big part of\ntheir playoff success and he
    may be thinking conservatively here.\n\nJoe\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\nBryant

  subject: ! '[Footballguys] Update # 160 11-21 Week 11 Passing Matchups'
  body: ! "Hi Folks,\n\nTrying to get this to you earlier as many people had asked
    for it sooner.\n\nHope you have a great and joyful Thanksgiving.\n\nHere's how
    I see the Passing Game Matchups this week.\n\nPLEASE NOTE:   See the cheatsheets
    online at www.footballguys.com  for\nexactly where I rank players and to determine
    who to start.   I always\nreceive emails asking me how I can have a guy ranked
    highly on the\ncheatsheet but listed under a matchup that favors the Defense.
    \  Just\nbecause one matchup may be more favorable than another, that doesn't\nnecessarily
    mean I'd start the player with the best matchup.   Peyton\nManning may have a
    horrible matchup one week but unless you're sitting on\nKurt Warner or Daunte
    Culpepper, Manning's your guy no matter who he's\nlining up against.   The matchup
    info is meant to be just one more tool in\nyour box when it comes to deciding
    between players.\n\nNote:  I've used the player stats sorted by performance over
    the last four\nweeks extensively in developing these write-ups. Stats are provided
    by Mike\nHall's excellent FLM League Management Software.  http://www.fflm.com/
    for\nmore info.   The points scored by position data is from our Footballguy\nClayton
    Gray.  Let's get to it.\n\nJoe\n\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\nPassing
    Game Matchups to Avoid and Exploit\n\n\nLocks:  These games feature Defenses that
    should be overmatched against the\nOffense.\n\n\nArizona Passing Game vs San Diego
    Defense\n\nWe rated Plummer as a \"Lock\" matchup and he delivered with 334 yards
    and 4\nTDs.   If only they could play Detroit each week...  This week, they'll
    face\na San Diego team that ranks just # 26 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game
    over\nthe last four weeks and # 23 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs.   WR David\nBoston
    is unstoppable and a must start.   Frank Sanders played well too last\nweek but
    had what looked to be a pretty serious hamstring injury on the TD\nreception.
    \  Check Plummer's status as he has a bruised tailbone but I'd\nfeel good about
    him again this week.\n\n\nAtlanta Passing Game vs Carolina Defense\n\nChris Chandler
    continued his up and down season with a nice outing last week\nleading the Falcons
    to a huge upset over the Packers.   He threw for 352\nyards and 2 TDs.   Terance
    Mathis led the way with 7 receptions.   Mathis\nsuffered a concussion but the
    early reports are that he'll be able to go.\nThis week, the Falcons face a soft
    Carolina defense that ranks # 21 in\nPassing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last
    four weeks.   For the year,\nthey rank # 30 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and
    # 23 in Fantasy Points\nAllowed to WRs so this is looking pretty enticing.\n\n\nChicago
    Passing Game vs Minnesota Defense\n\nJim Miller to Marty Booker looked more like
    Montana to Rice Sunday.   I\ndon't recall the last time I saw two consecutive
    bomb TDs to the same player\nlike that Sunday.   Miller's been up and down but
    clearly, Booker is a guy\nto watch.   Dez White and David Terrell are in the mix
    but this seems to be\nBooker's show.   The Viking defense ranks # 29 in Passing
    Yards Allowed Per\nGame over the last four weeks so it looks like the Bears may
    be able to\ncontinue to roll.\n\n\nGreen Bay Passing Game vs Detroit Defense\n\nFavre
    isn't as red hot as he was but he's still a premier QB.   He threw for\n262 yards
    and 2 TDs last week.   He spread the ball pretty well between\nBilly Schroeder,
    Antonio Freeman and Corey Bradford.   Bradford had the big\nyardage while Schroeder
    and Freeman scored.   All 3 are solid plays.   TE\nBubba Franks continues to be
    a non factor.   The Pack draw a great matchup\nthis week in Detroit that ranks
    # 27 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over\nthe last four weeks.   They rank
    # 31 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs so\nyou have to like that.\n\n\nMinnesota
    Passing Game vs Chicago Defense\n\nIf you'd been thinking about benching Daunte
    Culpepper, Randy Moss, or Cris\nCarter, you got your answer Monday night.   These
    guys should always be in\nyour lineup as they're too explosive to sit against
    any matchup.   The Bears\nrank # 31 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the
    last four weeks so\nclearly, this is a must start for these guys.   The only downside
    to the\nMoss / Carter explosion was that TE Byron Chamberlain was left out of
    the\nparty.\n\n\nSan Francisco Passing Game vs Indianapolis Defense\n\nYou don't
    need me to tell you to start Jeff Garcia.   He's clearly one of\nthe premier QBs
    in the game.   Terrell Owens is freaky good and is obviously\na must start.   J.J.
    Stokes had a breakout game last week so he deserves a\nlook.   Tai Streets is
    not a bad reach and TE Eric Johnson is getting more\ninvolved in the offense each
    week.   It's sort of like St. Louis where any\nof these guys are worth a gamble.
    \  Indy ranks # 23 in Passing Yards Allowed\nPer Game over the last four weeks.
    \  They rank # 25 in Fantasy Points\nAllowed to QBs and # 26 in Fantasy Points
    Allowed to WRs so the 49ers are\nlooking good here.\n\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\n\nPrime
    Matchups:  These games feature Defenses that should have trouble\nstopping the
    Offense.\n\n\nBaltimore Passing Game vs Jacksonville Defense\n\nDoes anyone else
    find the Baltimore's self destruction amusing?   The Grbac\ntear thing on the
    sidelines (which looked like sweat to me) and then Shannon\nSharpe's posturing
    as the self appointed spokesperson shouting about\ninterceptions was pretty funny.
    \  Can Brian Billick hold it all together?\nWhere's Trent Dilfer when you need
    him?   Grbac will be fine I think.\nSharpe is always a good play if you can stand
    having him on your team.\nQadry Ismail and Travis Taylor are both decent options
    as they're seeing\nplenty of action and TE Todd Heap even got a score.   Lots
    of weapons in\nthis passing game.   They'll be facing a Jaguar defense that's
    reeling and\nbeat up.   They rank # 25 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over
    the last\nfour weeks.   Jacksonville ranks # 18 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs
    for\nthe year.   All in all, a good matchup here.\n\n\nDetroit Passing Game vs
    Green Bay Defense\n\nA perfect example of how sometimes the NFL does NOT mirror
    Fantasy.\nCharlie Batch is becoming a desirable QB simply because his team is
    so bad\nand he's forced to throw on every down.   Regardless of the reason, you
    have\nto give this guy some credit as he's clearly becoming more comfortable in\nthe
    system.   He threw an amazing 62 attempts last week for 436 yards and 3\nTDs.
    \  I'll take that.   WR Johnnie Morton led the way with 153 yards.   RB\nLamont
    Warren had 11 catches but his status is up in the air with the return\nof James
    Stewart.   Green Bay is nothing special against the pass lately\nranking # 22
    in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.\nFor the year, they
    are pretty tough on QBs though ranking # 8 in Fantasy\nPoints Allowed to QBs and
    # 3 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.\n\n\nKansas City Passing Game vs Seattle
    Defense\n\nTrent Green had a week off to get everything together but you have
    to wonder\nhow much can be done in a week.   Derrick Alexander is supposedly ready
    to\nplay this week but you know how that goes.   I'd be leery until I see him\nplay
    some.   Snoop Minnis is still nursing an ankle injury and is iffy.   As\nalways,
    TE Tony Gonzalez is the primary threat.   Seattle has been below\naverage lately
    ranking # 20 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last\nfour weeks.   For
    the year, they rank # 29 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs\nand # 25 in Fantasy
    Points Allowed to WRs.\n\n\nNew England Passing Game vs New Orleans Defense\n\nCoach
    Bill Belichick raised some eyebrows when he announced Tom Brady would\nbe the
    starter until further notice.   Great news for Brady fans who'd been\nsweating
    a Bledsoe comeback.   Brady's come back down to earth lately with a\nmediocre
    185 yard day last week but he's still showing promise.   WR Troy\nBrown is by
    far the favored target and the only real receiver worthy of a\nstart in most leagues.
    \  New Orleans has been very vulnerable lately to the\npass ranking # 30 in Passing
    Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four\nweeks.   For the year, they rank #
    16 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs.\n\n\nNew Orleans Passing Game vs New England
    Defense\n\nAaron Brooks once again offers some vindication for those (including
    us)\nwho'd been sweating it after giving him lots of preseason hype.   2 passing\nTDs
    plus another TD rushing Sunday made his owners happy.   I'd go with the\nhot hand
    and keep him in your lineup.   Joe Horn is clearly the WR of choice\nas Willie
    Jackson is up and down.   TE Boo Williams is not a bad reach if\nyou need a guy
    there.   He caught 2 TDs and looked good doing it.   New\nEngland ranks # 24 in
    Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four\nweeks but be careful, as Bill
    Belichick seems to sometimes pull out\nsomething special to confuse young QBs.\n\n\nOakland
    Passing Game vs New York Giants Defense\n\nYou have to like Rich Gannon here against
    the Giant defense that was torched\nby Minnesota last week.   Gannon threw for
    311 yards and 4 TDs Sunday and\nlooks as in control of this offense as ever.   Jerry
    Rice looked half his\nage running all over the field and played outstanding.   Tim
    Brown is as\ngood as ever.   This team has serious weapons and should go deep
    in the\nplayoffs, if not all the way.   The Giants rank # 15 in Passing Yards\nAllowed
    Per Game over the last four weeks but for the year they rank # 3 in\nFantasy Points
    Allowed to QBs.\n\n\nPittsburgh Passing Game vs Tennessee Defense\n\nKordell Stewart
    once again looked like a real NFL QB.   He threw for 266\nyards and a TD.   Most
    importantly, he didn't fold up when Jerome Bettis was\nheld down.   Hines Ward
    caught 9 passes for 112 yards and a TD and looks to\nbe a good play most every
    week as he's clearly the go to guy.   Tennessee\nranks just # 19 in Passing Yards
    Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.\nThey rank # 26 for the year in Fantasy
    Points Allowed to QBs so these\nSteelers could have a chance to do something through
    the air here.\n\n\nSan Diego Passing Game vs Arizona Defense\n\nDoug Flutie's
    magic trick bag seems to be fairly well empty lately.   Losing\nTE Freddie Jones
    last week surely didn't help even though Jones wasn't being\nthrown to as much
    as we'd like to see.   Curtis Conway and Jeff Graham\nstruggled with Flutie.   This
    Arizona defense could be the ticket though as\nCharlie Batch discovered last week.
    \  They rank # 17 in Passing Yards\nAllowed Per Game over the last four weeks
    but are playing softer than that.\nThey rank # 27 in Fantasy Points Allowed to
    QBs and # 24 in Fantasy Points\nAllowed to WRs.\n\n\nSt. Louis Passing Game vs
    Tampa Bay Defense\n\nKurt Warner's a must start, obviously.   As are Isaac Bruce
    and Torry Holt.\nBoth are outstanding.   Bruce had the big yards Sunday while
    Holt got the\nTD.   RB Marshall Faulk catches as many passes as the WRs, just
    another\nreason why he's the best.   Tampa is limping but they rank # 9 in Passing\nYards
    Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   They do have 13 sacks\nover the last
    4 games so they're obviously putting pressure on the QB.\n\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\n\nEven
    Matchups:  These games feature no real advantage either way\n\n\nCarolina Passing
    Game vs Atlanta Defense\n\nAre you really down to starting Chris Weinke?   I didn't
    think so.   Muhsin\nMuhammad could miss this week's game with a shoulder injury.
    \  That means\nDonald Hayes would be the go to guy assuming his sore ribs allow
    him to go.\nTE Wesley Walls is always a threat although he seems to be less of
    the focus\nlately.   Maybe he needs to have another \"Keyshawn Fit\" and yell
    about not\ngetting the ball enough.   That worked pretty well for him last time.
    \  The\nFalcons rank # 12 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four
    weeks\nbut for the year, rank # 28 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs.   They rank
    #\n30 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs so they're definitely toastable.\n\n\nCincinnati
    Passing Game vs Cleveland Defense\n\nIt doesn't appear to be the best thing for
    the Bengals, but Jon Kitna\ncontinues to air it out.   He threw 42 passes Sunday
    for 234 yards and 1 TD\n/ 2 Interceptions.   The Bengals have about 25 WRs it
    seems and all are\npretty good.   Ron Dugans got into the act scoring a TD Sunday.
    \  Darnay\nScott is the # 1 but it's a crowded group there making it tough to
    pick out\nany one player.   The Brown defense ranks # 28 in Passing Yards Allowed
    Per\nGame over the last four weeks so you'd think Cincinnati would be able to\nthrow
    the ball.    For the year, Cleveland ranks # 5 in Fantasy Points\nAllowed to QBs
    though so it's not like it's a cakewalk.\n\n\nCleveland Passing Game vs Cincinnati
    Defense\n\nTim Couch is winning the \"real\" NFL games even though he's not doing
    much\nfor your FF team lately.   His 144 yard / 0 TD / 3 Int game Sunday is an\nexample
    of that.   He'll get back on track though.   Kevin Johnson and\nDennis Northcutt
    seem to be his primary guys with Quincy Morgan there too.\nHonestly, I wouldn't
    count on too much from anyone but Johnson.   The Bengal\ndefense ranks # 10 in
    Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four\nweeks so they've been tough
    lately.   For the year, they rank # 22 in\nFantasy Points Allowed to QBs.\n\n\nIndianapolis
    Passing Game vs San Francisco Defense\n\nPeyton Manning looked solid even with
    the broken jaw.   Jerome Pathon is\ngone for the year and Reggie Wayne's knee
    is an issue.   It looks like it'll\nbe his old reliable target, Marvin Harrison.
    \  Keep an eye on TE Marcus\nPollard as he could easily be the best receiver after
    Harrison.   San\nFrancisco ranks # 13 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the
    last four\nweeks and # 19 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs.   You never know when\nManning
    will throw that monster game though so it's tough not to play him if\nhe's on
    your roster.\n\n\nPhiladelphia Passing Game vs Washington Defense\n\nDonovan McNabb
    didn't wow anyone with his numbers Sunday but he didn't need\nto in order to win
    the game.   He threw for 129 yards with 1 TD.   James\nThrash is still the go
    to guy with Todd Pinkston worth a roll of the dice in\nlarger leagues.   TE Chad
    Lewis was pretty active and caught a TD so you\nlike to see that.   The Redskins
    are starting to believe in themselves and\nnow rank # 18 in Passing Yards Allowed
    Per Game over the last four weeks.\nA dangerous game against the Redskins who
    have nothing to lose and can play\nwith abandon.\n\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\n\nDownside
    Matchups:  These games feature a Defense that could pose trouble\nfor the Offense.\n\n\nBuffalo
    Passing Game vs Miami Defense\n\nAs a consistent Rob Johnson basher, Alex Van
    Pelt kept me from looking bad\nby playing extremely well Sunday with 2 TDs and
    316 yards.   And he actually\nfinished a game...   Clearly, he gives the Bills
    a boost.   Eric Moulds is\nstill the #1 WR but Peerless Price had a huge game
    with 138 yards and a TD.\nLarry Centers was also extremely involved and TE Jay
    Riemersma caught a TD.\nMiami is hurting without CB Sam Madison.   They rank #
    6 in Passing Yards\nAllowed Per Game over the last four weeks so they're still
    tough.\n\n\nDenver Passing Game vs Dallas Defense\n\nBrian Griese just keeps losing
    weapons.   From Ed McCaffrey to Terrell\nDavis, now Rod Smith is limited with
    a bad ankle.   There's only so much a\nQB can do without his weapons.   Smith
    is saying he'll try to tough it out\nand play Thursday but it's very questionable
    how effective he'll be if he\nplays.   My friend (and Denver local) B.J. Miller
    says his guess is that\nSmith will dress but likely not finish the game after
    re-aggravating the\nankle.  I'd agree with that prediction.   TE Desmond Clark
    needs to become a\nbigger part of the passing game here.   The Cowboys are solid
    on defense\nranking # 5 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks
    and #\n10 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs so it's a tough matchup here for the\nBroncos.\n\n\nNew
    York Giants Passing Game vs Oakland Defense\n\nKerry Collins threw for 321 yards
    but couldn't find the endzone Monday\nnight.   Ike Hilliard continues to improve
    and actually was more effective\nthan Amani Toomer.  Tiki Barber remains a strong
    force in the passing game\nand that should continue.   All 3 of these guys are
    solid starters.\nOakland is very solid lately against the pass ranking # 4 in
    Passing Yards\nAllowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they
    rank # 15 in\nFantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 16 in Fantasy Points Allowed
    to WRs.\n\n\nSeattle Passing Game vs Kansas City Defense\n\nMatt Hasselbeck posted
    134 yards and 1 TD Sunday.   With the way Shaun\nAlexander is running, that's
    probably enough.   Koren Robinson and Darrel\nJackson are the primary targets
    but Hasselbeck is really spreading the ball\naround.   Kansas City ranks # 14
    in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the\nlast four weeks although for the year,
    they rank # 6 in Fantasy Points\nAllowed to QBs.\n\n\nTampa Bay Passing Game vs
    St. Louis Defense\n\nBrad Johnson rolled up 399 yards Sunday without throwing
    a TD.   That's hard\nto do.   Keyshawn Johnson remains TD-less which I admit is
    cruelly amusing.\nThat'll have to break soon though as he's just catching too
    many passes not\nto score.   I wouldn't be surprised to see him explode with a
    couple of\nmultiple TD games as the odds even out.   Johnson to Johnson is really
    all\nthere is to talk about with this passing game.   The Rams are solid ranking\n#
    7 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   For the\nyear,
    they rank # 12 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs.\n\n\nWashington Passing Game
    vs Philadelphia Defense\n\nTony Banks left with a concussion Sunday but Kent Graham
    did a fine job\nfilling in.   WR Michael Westbrook has shown nice maturity this
    season\nhanging in there and now looks to be the quality WR everyone has always\nexpected
    him to be.   He had 9 receptions for 104 yards and a TD last week.\nThe Eagle
    defense can be troublesome with all their blitzing so it'll be a\nchallenge.   Philadelphia
    ranks # 11 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over\nthe last four weeks and for
    the year, they rank # 1 in Fantasy Points\nAllowed to QBs.   Should be a tough
    game.\n\n\n\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\n\nDefensive
    Slam Dunks:  These games feature a very tough Defense posing major\nproblems for
    the Offense.\n\n\nDallas Passing Game vs Denver Defense\n\nRyan Leaf did little
    to impress anyone Sunday with a 102  yard / 0 TD / 2\nInterception game.   I can't
    get excited about anyone on this offense.\nJoey Galloway could be worth a shot
    just for his home run potential but it's\npretty bleak overall.   Denver ranks
    # 8 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game\nover the last four weeks and that doesn't
    help any.\n\n\nJacksonville Passing Game vs Baltimore Defense\n\nMark Brunell
    is looking very iffy again and it'll likely be Jonathon Quinn\nagain.   (Has there
    ever been a good QB named Jonathon?)   That's bad news\nfor the Jaguar WRs Jimmy
    Smith and Keenan McCardell although both played\ndecent last week.   With Fred
    Taylor out again, Baltimore should have a\nfield day.   The Ravens rank # 16 in
    Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the\nlast four weeks but for the year, rank
    # 7 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs.\nI'd shy away from these guys unless I had
    few options.\n\n\nMiami Passing Game vs Buffalo Defense\n\nJay Fiedler looked
    lost last week throwing for 188 yards, 0 TDs and 3\nInterceptions.   He'll have
    his up and down games but he seems to be\nsettling back more toward the downside.
    \  His WR corps is solid with James\nMcKnight, Oronde Gadsden and Chris Chambers
    but it's hard to put a lot of\nfaith in Fiedler.   I do like Chambers and his
    big play ability.   Buffalo\nhas been tough lately ranking # 3 in Passing Yards
    Allowed Per Game over the\nlast four weeks.   It's actually not so much an issue
    of them being tough as\nit is teams just don't need to throw to beat them.   Regardless,
    offenses\nhaven't been putting up a lot of yards on them.   For the year, they
    rank #\n24 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs.\n\n\nTennessee Passing Game vs Pittsburgh
    Defense\n\nA typical Steve McNair week:   Major questions all week as to whether
    he'll\nbe healthy enough to play.   Guts it out through the game, rushing for
    more\nyards than George, throwing for 172 yards and 1 TD.   It might win NFL games\nbut
    that probably won't carry your FF team.   Derrick Mason and Kevin Dyson\nare both
    decent players at WR while TE Frank Wycheck remains his best\nreceiver.   The
    Steelers bring a great defense though ranking # 2 in Passing\nYards Allowed Per
    Game over the last four weeks.   They rank # 2 in Fantasy\nPoints Allowed to QBs
    not to mention the fact they've logged 18 sacks over\nthe last 4 games.   Tough
    matchup here.\n\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\nBryant

  body: ! "\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\nHi Folks,\n\nI
    know many of you have early deadlines this week so I juggled my schedule\nto get
    these early.   Here's how I see the Rushing Game Matchups this week.\n\nPLEASE
    NOTE:   See the cheatsheet online www.footballguys.com for exactly\nwhere I rank
    players and to determine who to start.   I always receive\nemails asking me how
    I can have a guy ranked highly on the cheatsheet but\nlisted under a matchup that
    favors the Defense.   Just because one matchup\nmay be more favorable than another,
    that doesn't necessarily mean I'd start\nthe player with the best matchup.   Ahman
    Green may have a horrible matchup\none week but unless you're sitting on Ricky
    Williams or Marshall Faulk,\nGreen's your guy no matter who he's lining up against.
    \  The matchup info is\nmeant to be just one more tool in your box when it comes
    to deciding between\nplayers.\n\nStats are provided by Mike Hall's excellent FLM
    League Management Software.\nhttp://www.fflm.com/ for more info.   Fantasy Points
    Allowed by position\nnumbers are from ESPN.com.\nLet's get to it.\n\nJoe\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\n\nLocks:
    \ These games feature Defenses that should be overmatched against the\nOffense.\n\n\nAtlanta's
    Maurice Smith vs Carolina Defense\n\nSmith was upstaged last week by big Bob Christian
    who looked great on the TD\npass reception and run.   Smith had 43 yards on 19
    carries (2.3 ypc)  Keep\nan eye on his health as he was nicked in Sunday's game.
    \  Smith has been up\nand down but facing this Carolina defense may be what he
    needs.   The\nPanthers are ranked # 31 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over
    the last 4\nweeks and # 29 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.   If you've been
    thinking\nabout starting Smith, this could be the week.\n\n\nGreen Bay's Ahman
    Green vs Detroit Defense\n\nAhman Green was semi quiet running the ball against
    Atlanta last week\ncarring 17 times for 62 yards (3.6 ypc)   He'll face a soft
    defense this\nweek against the Lions.   Detroit ranks # 26 in Rushing Yards Allowed
    per\nGame over the last 4 weeks and # 24 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.\nGreen's
    a sure starter here.\n\n\nSan Diego's LaDainian Tomlinson vs Arizona Defense\n\nEveryone
    keeps talking about the \"rookie wall\" and Tomlinson just keeps\nplugging.   Sunday,
    he posted 68 yards on 22 carries (3.1 ypc) plus a TD.\nNot bad.   This week, he
    faces the soft Cardinal defense that ranks # 23 in\nRushing Yards Allowed per
    Game over the last 4 weeks and # 28 for the year\nin Fantasy Points Allowed to
    RBs.   If Tomlinson's been your guy, I'd\ncertainly start him again here.\n\n\nSeattle's
    Shaun Alexander vs Kansas City Defense\n\nAlexander continues to have a bulldog
    like hold on the starting RB job.\nCoach Mike Holmgren is now softening his stance
    on Ricky Watters' return\nsaying Watters might be the 3rd down back when he returns.
    \  But even that\nseems to be a couple of weeks away.   Alexander is the man.
    \  He'll face a\nChief defense that ranks # 27 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game
    over the\nlast 4 weeks.   Alexander has to be licking his chops though at their
    # 31\nranking in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.\n\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\n\nPrime
    Matchups:  These games feature Defenses that should have trouble\nstopping the
    Offense.\n\n\nBaltimore's Jason Brookins vs Jacksonville Defense\n\nBrookins did
    a nice job last week against Cleveland carrying the ball 21\ntimes for 89 yards
    (4.2 ypc)   I'd expect him to improve each week as he\ngets more comfortable in
    the role of #1 RB.   He didn't catch any passes so\nthat's a little bit of a worry.
    \  This week, he faces a Jacksonville Defense\nthat did a pretty good against
    Jerome Bettis last week.   They rank # 21 in\nRushing Yards Allowed per Game over
    the last 4 weeks and # 11 in Fantasy\nPoints Allowed to RBs.   Watch very closely
    how the team and self appointed\nspokesman Shannon Sharpe handle the Elvis Grbac
    4 interceptions thing.\nCould lead to a more conservative gameplan with a focus
    on running the ball\nmore.\n\n\nCincinnati's Corey Dillon vs Cleveland Defense\n\nCorey
    Dillon showed last week why he gets saddled with the inconsistency\nrep.   17
    carries for 38 yards (2.2 ypc) won't carry your team.   The sad\nthing is he's
    so hard to predict when he'll break out.   This week, he faces\na Cleveland Defense
    that's ranked # 28 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game\nover the last 4 weeks so
    you'd have to think he has a chance.   The Browns\nrank # 22 in Fantasy Points
    Allowed to RBs as well.\n\n\nChicago's Anthony Thomas vs Minnesota Defense\n\nThomas
    didn't make much noise last week with just 58 yards on 23 carries\n(2.5 ypc)   Fantasy
    owners are trying to decide who the real Thomas is.\nThis week, he'll face a soft
    Viking defense that ranks # 30 in Rushing Yards\nAllowed per Game over the last
    4 weeks and # 26 in Fantasy Points Allowed to\nRBs.   I think we'll see him get
    back on track.   The Bear passing game will\ndefinitely open up some lanes for
    him.\n\n\nMiami's Lamar Smith vs Buffalo Defense\n\nThe Lamar Smith woes continue.
    \  He showed glimpses of breaking out but\nwound up with 53 yards on 19 carries
    (2.8 ypc)   I'm not as worried about\nTravis Minor stealing too much from him
    as he only managed 9 yards on 6\ncarries (1.5 ypc)   This Miami running game has
    faded quickly.   They'll\nface a soft Buffalo defense this week that ranks # 22
    in Rushing Yards\nAllowed per Game over the last 4 weeks and # 25 in Fantasy Points
    Allowed to\nRBs.\n\n\nNew York's Tiki Barber / Ron Dayne vs Oakland Defense\n\nBarber
    looked very good Monday while Dayne was awful.   Barber rushed 8\ntimes for 55
    yards plus he caught 4 passes for 52 yards.   Dayne, on the\nother hand, rushed
    4 times for a whopping minus 3 ypc.   (NEGATIVE 0.8 ypc)\nThe Raider defense isn't
    much ranking # 29 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game\nover the last 4 weeks and
    # 19 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs so this is\nprobably a good matchup.   At
    least for Barber.   I'd start Dayne at your\nown risk until he shows me something.\n\n\nNew
    Orleans' Ricky Williams vs New England Defense\n\nStart Ricky Williams.   He's
    rolling.  120 yards on 28 carries (4.3 ypc)\nplus another 48 receiving.   The
    re-emergence of QB Aaron Brooks is a huge\nfactor and Ricky should keep it up.
    \  New England ranks # 10 in Rushing\nYards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks
    but I wouldn't let that deter\nme at all.\n\n\nSan Francisco's Garrison Hearst
    / Kevan Barlow vs Indianapolis Defense\n\nHearst continued the miracle story with
    another fine outing last week.   He\nhad 92 yards on 17 carries plus he caught
    6 passes for 21 yards.   He looks\nto be too much for Kevan Barlow to overtake
    at this point.   Barlow did have\n7 carries but it looks pretty clear that Hearst
    is the guy.  The Colt\ndefense ranks # 20 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over
    the last 4 weeks.\nFor the year, they rank # 27 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.\n\n\nSt.
    Louis' Marshall Faulk vs Tampa Bay Defense\n\nYou don't need me to tell you to
    start Faulk.   Just do it and count your\nblessings that you own one of the best
    players in the universe.\n\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\n\nEven
    Matchups:  These games feature no real advantage either way\n\n\nArizona's Michael
    Pittman vs San Diego Defense\n\nPittman ran pretty hard last week gaining 81 yards
    on 23 carries (3.5 ypc)\nbut yielded a TD to Thomas Jones last week.   That's
    not good.   This\nCharger defense is definitely one that can be run on as they
    rank # 24 in\nRushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks.   They don't
    give up\nmany points though as evidenced by their # 8 ranking for the year in
    Fantasy\nPoints Allowed to RBs.   The Arizona offense was clicking last week (albeit\nagainst
    Detroit) but it's a little unclear as to exactly how Pittman fits\nin.\n\n\nCarolina's
    Richard Huntley vs Atlanta Defense\n\nHuntley was much more involved this past
    week and showed his owners some\nsigns of life.   He rushed 13 times for 63 yards
    (4.8 ypc) and also caught 5\npasses.   Encouraging signs.   This week he faces
    a Falcon defense that\ncould be primed for a letdown after the big Green Bay win.
    \  They rank # 25\nin Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks and
    # 15 in Fantasy\nPoints Allowed to RBs.\n\n\nDallas' Emmitt Smith vs Denver Defense\n\nEmmitt
    actually looked pretty good last week returning from injury to post\n80 yards
    on 15 carries (5.3 ypc)   He was nicked late in the game so check\nhis status
    this week but he looks like he'll be ok for Thursday's game.\nThe Broncos rank
    # 16 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4\nweeks but are still pretty
    strong for the year ranking # 9 in Fantasy Points\nAllowed to RBs.\n\n\nDenver's
    Mike Anderson vs Dallas Defense\n\nAnderson posted a whopping 31 yards on 13 carries
    (2.4 ypc) against the\nRedskins last week.   Olandis Gary didn't do any better
    with 28 yards on 10\ncarries (2.8 ypc)   At this point, you'd have to say the
    entire Bronco\noffense is in disarray.   WR Rod Smith's injury is a huge factor
    as they're\nsimply not the same with him less than 100%.   This week, they face
    a pretty\ngood defense in Dallas that ranks # 14 in Rushing Yards Allowed per
    Game\nover the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 10 in Fantasy Points\nAllowed
    to RBs.   Being a short week will not help matters.\n\n\nIndianapolis' Dominic
    Rhodes vs San Francisco Defense\n\nDominic Rhodes didn't make anyone forget about
    Edgerrin James but he did\nprove what we all were thinking - Being the # 1 RB
    for Indy is not a bad\nthing.   He got the score and also rolled up 67 yards on
    18 carries.   And\nhe'll likely improve.   Not bad for a guy who probably wasn't
    drafted in\nyour league.   The 49er defense is average ranking # 18 in Rushing
    Yards\nAllowed per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 20
    in\nFantasy Points Allowed to RBs.\n\n\nKansas City's Priest Holmes / Tony Richardson
    vs Seattle Defense\n\nAfter a bye week of rest, Holmes will see how he fares against
    the Seahawk\ndefense.   Seattle ranks # 19 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over
    the\nlast 4 weeks and # 12 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.   They're nothing\nspecial
    but they do a nice job of shutting down Travis Henry and Buffalo\nlast week.\n\n\nOakland's
    Charlie Garner / Tyrone Wheatley vs New York Giants Defense\n\nEveryone (including
    me) hoped that Charlie Garner would take advantage of\nthe opportunity with Wheatley
    out to show he could be a full time # 1 RB.\nJust didn't happen.   Now Wheatley
    is reportedly back and ready to go and\nGarner looks to keep running it between
    the 20s while Wheatley or Zack\nCrockett punch it in at the goalline.   Garner
    still puts the yards up\nthough.   Sunday, he rushed for 59 yards and caught another
    41.   The Giants\ndefense ranks # 13 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the
    last 4 weeks\nand showed last night they can be vulnerable.\n\n\nWashington's
    Stephen Davis vs Philadelphia Defense\n\nStephen Davis continues to roll up the
    yards.   Last week, he totaled 84\nyards on 23 carries (3.7 ypc)   This week,
    he faces a decent Eagle defense\nthat ranks # 17 in Rushing Yards Allowed per
    Game over the last 4 weeks and\n# 14 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.   Tony
    Banks will likely be back at\nQB although Kent Graham did fine.\n\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\n\nDownside
    Matchups:  These games feature a Defense that could pose trouble\nfor the Offense.\n\n\nBuffalo's
    Travis Henry / Larry Centers vs Miami Defense\n\nTravis Henry looked pretty bad
    last week.  13 carries for 29 yards (2.2 ypc)\njust isn't going to cut it for
    you.   Throwing 2 fumbles on top of that\ncould put his playing time in jeopardy.
    \ Sammy Morris and Shawn Bryson are\nchamping at the bit.   Don't forget about
    Larry Centers.   He had 66 yards\nreceiving on 8 passes Sunday and those are likely
    valuable stats in your\nleague.   The Dolphin Defense ranks # 7 in Rushing Yards
    Allowed per Game\nover the last 4 weeks so it'll be no cakewalk.\n\n\nCleveland's
    James Jackson / Ben Gay vs Cincinnati Defense\n\nJackson was a late scratch from
    Sunday's game and Ben Gay made the most of\nhis opportunity.   You gotta love
    this guy.   He's a very hard runner and\nwhile raw, displayed some nice talent.
    \  I'm guessing Gay's play will be the\nbest \"rehab\" Jackson could ever receive.
    \  Jackson is reportedly ready to go\nagainst Cincinnati this week.   The Bengals
    are pretty tough against the run\nranking # 11.   For the year, they rank # 17
    in Fantasy Points Allowed to\nRBs.\n\n\nNew England's Antowain Smith vs New Orleans
    Defense\n\nSmith struggled against the Rams Sunday night with 36 yards on 15 carries\n(2.4
    ypc)   I'd expect tough going again this week against the Saints that\nrank #
    15 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks and # 13\nin Fantasy
    Points Allowed to RBs.   New England seems to be coming back to\nearth a bit and
    you know the Tom Brady / Drew Bledsoe thing has to be a\ndistraction for the team.\n\n\nPhiladelphia's
    Duce Staley vs Washington Defense\n\nAny worries Duce Staley owners had about
    Correll Buckhalter stealing time\nwent up in smoke last week. (sorry)   Staley
    looked like the Duce of old\nrolling up 102 yards on 26 carries.   He threw in
    4 receptions for 31 yards\nto boot.   Washington is surprisingly tough against
    the run ranking # 4 in\nRushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks.
    \  It won't be a\ncakewalk but still you have to like Staley with the way they're
    playing now.\n\n\nPittsburgh's Jerome Bettis vs Tennessee Defense\n\nBettis was
    held very much in check last week with the exception of one 40\nyard run.   Even
    with the big run, his totals of 52 yards on 21 carries (2.5\nypc) weren't much.
    \  Won't be much easier this week against a good Tennesee\ndefense that ranks
    # 6 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4\nweeks.   The Titans shut
    down Corey Dillon last week who has a similar power\nstyle.   I'd have a hard
    time not starting Bettis though as he's definitely\nthe focus of this offense
    and getting better as QB Kordell Stewart continues\nto improve.\n\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\n\nDefensive
    Slam Dunks:  These games feature a very tough Defense posing major\nproblems for
    the Offense.\n\n\nDetroit's James Stewart / Lamont Warren / Corey Schlesinger
    vs Green Bay\nDefense\n\nTalk about a muddy situation.   Last week, Lamont Warren,
    Corey Schlesinger,\nand Rueben Droughns each had at least 6 carries.   And just
    for good\nmeasure, James Stewart is reportedly ready to play this week.   Throw
    in the\nadded bonus that Green Bay is very tough and ranked # 3 in Rushing Yards\nAllowed
    per Game over the last 4 weeks.   That's enough to make me shy away\nfrom all
    these guys.   (That and the fact Charlie Batch may throw it 75\ntimes...)\n\n\nJacksonville's
    Stacey Mack vs Baltimore Defense\n\nAs we told our readers today, the news isn't
    good for Fred Taylor.   His doc\nis telling him to stay out of the lineup for
    this week and they're sounding\nway too vague for my liking as to when he'll be
    back.   That probably means\nMack gets the call by default.   He posted a stellar
    6 yard on 8 rushes (0.8\nypc) day.   Yes, ZERO point 8.   Elvis Joseph can run
    back kicks but he only\nmanaged 6 yards on his 3 carries.   And QB Mark Brunell
    could miss the game\nwith his leg injury.   All in all, pretty ugly going against
    the Ravens\nDefense who's fallen down to # 12 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game
    over the\nlast 4 weeks but is still nasty.\n\n\nMinnesota's Michael Bennett vs
    Chicago Defense\n\nBennett got the carries Monday night while Doug Chapman saw
    no action.\nBennett had 33 yards on 11 carries (3.3 ypc) so you'd have to think
    he's on\nthe right track back.   When Culpepper, Moss and Carter play like they
    did\nMonday, it's pretty clear the Vikings won't need a lot from their RB.   This\nweek
    he'll face a much tougher opponent in Chicago.   The Bears rank # 5 in\nRushing
    Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks and are playing very\nwell.   For
    the year, they rank # 6 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs so\nit'll be a tough
    matchup coming off a short week.\n\n\nTampa Bay's Warrick Dunn / Mike Alstott
    vs St. Louis Defense\n\nDunn and Alstott put up pitiful numbers Sunday.   Dunn
    had 12 yards on 8\ncarries (1.5 ypc)   Alstott had 2 yards on 4 carries (0.5 ypc)
    although he\ndid get a score.   Granted, it was against a tough Chicago team but
    that's\nawful.   This week, they'll face an injury riddled St. Louis team that
    ranks\n# 2 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks.   Even with
    the\ninjuries, I don't like either of these RBs here.\n\n\nTennessee's Eddie George
    vs Pittsburgh Defense\n\nIt's bad when the QB out rushes the # 1 RB but that's
    what happened last\nweek.   George put up 61 yards on 23 carries (2.7 ypc) and
    seemed to take a\nstep back.   The trouble with him is that his game is so power
    oriented,\nthat when the holes aren't there, he simply can't do much.   This week,\nit'll
    be much tougher against the swarming Steeler defense ranked # 1 in\nRushing Yards
    Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks.   They rank # 3 in\nFantasy Points Allowed
    to RBs.   I'm not one for benching your best players\nbut this is one matchup
    you'll want to look at very closely.\n\n\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\n\nThat'll

  subject: ! '[Footballguys] Update # 158 11-19 Week 11 Upgrade - Downgrade'
  body: ! "Hi Folks,\n\nOur Footballguy Scott Luebke takes a look at this week's Updgrades
    and\nDowngrades.\n\nEnjoy!\n\nJoe\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\n\nUpgrades\n\nQB
    - Aaron Brooks - Brooks and the Saints offense are clicking now and\nBrooks' fantasy
    owners must be ecstatic.  Brooks has scored multiple\ntouchdowns in 3 of the last
    4 weeks and I expect this trend to continue for\nthe remainder of the season.
    \ With an easier schedule and better decision\nmaking, Brooks has been able to
    connect with Aaron Brooks, Willie Jackson\nand breakout tight end Boo Williams.\n\nQB
    - Jeff Garcia - Garcia continues to put up exceptional numbers.  He has\nthrown
    for 3 or more touchdowns in 5 of the last 6 games.  I wouldn't bench\nGarcia in
    favor of any quarterback in the league right now.  He is a stud.\n\nQB - Charlie
    Batch - Batch's 436 yard, 3 touchdown performance deserves\nrecognition.  However,
    I still think Batch will see bench time as the Lions\ngive backup Mike McMahon
    some playing time towards the end of the season for\nthe winless Lions.  A tough
    schedule remains for Batch and the Lions as\nGreen Bay, Chicago (2), Tampa Bay
    and Pittsburgh are left on the schedule.\n\nQB - Rich Gannon - A strong performance
    on Sunday with 311 yards and 4\ntouchdowns proves Gannon and the Raiders offense
    is the team to beat in the\nAFC.  With Tim Brown and Jerry Rice looking fantastic,
    Gannon will continue\nto post good numbers for the remainder of the season.\n\nQB
    - Kurt Warner - Warner looked good on Sunday night with 401 yards and 3\ntouchdowns.
    \ More importantly, he did not appear to be hampered by a thumb\ninjury that has
    been nagging him throughout the season.  As always, keep\nWarner in your starting
    lineup.\n\nQB - Jake Plummer - Plummer looked good on Sunday with 334 passing
    yards and\n4 touchdowns.  Keep in mind, this performance was against the hapless
    Lions.\nLook for Plummer to return to his normal erratic self in the next two
    weeks\nagainst San Diego and Oakland.  Plummer might be a good option for playoff\nweeks
    as he faces Dallas in week 15 and Carolina in week 16.\n\n\n\nRB - Shaun Alexander
    - Plain and simple, Alexander produces when he is in\nthe lineup.  He scored his
    10th touchdown of the season on Sunday and nearly\ncleared 100 yards once again.
    \ Look for Alexander to remain the starter once\nWatters returns from injury.\n\nRB
    -  Duce Staley - Staley continues to look better and better.  The 133\ntotal yards
    on Sunday will be a sign of things to come for Staley in the\nsecond half of the
    season.  Philadelphia's offense and a rock solid defense\nwill keep the Eagles
    in the lead in the majority of games.  With Correll\nBuckhalter in trouble with
    a team suspension due to marijuana, Staley will\nnot lose many carries to Buckhalter.\n\nRB
    - Warrick Dunn - Dunn managed just 12 yards rushing against a solid Bears\ndefense,
    but a 12 catch, 138 yard receiving performance helps vault him into\nthe upgrades
    section.  More importantly, it appears that Dunn has returned\nto 100% after being
    hampered by foot and hamstring injuries.\n\nRB - Garrison Hearst - Hearst nearly
    reached the 100-yard plateau once\nagain.  He has looked good the last few weeks
    and should continue this trend\nfor the remainder of the season.  The 49ers offense
    continues to look good\nand a favorable schedule gives Hearst the advantage over
    a majority of\nstarting running backs in the league.\n\nRB - Ricky Williams -
    The Saints offense is looking sharp and efficient.\nWith Brooks making wise decisions,
    the offense will continue to get better\nand this will lead to more scoring opportunities
    for Williams.  Williams has\ntopped the 120 yard mark in consecutive weeks.  Look
    for this trend to\ncontinue as the Saints have a favorable schedule in the second
    half of the\nseason.\n\n\n\nWR - Marty Booker - The Bears finally starting passing
    the ball downfield\nand Booker's statistics were directly affected.  He burned
    the Buccaneers\nfor 3 long touchdowns on the day and made it look rather easy.
    \ Look for\nmore longer passes out of the Bears in the second half of the season.
    \ With\nteams starting to \"sell out\" to the run, Booker and Miller should connect
    on\nsome play action pass touchdowns.\n\nWR - Joe Horn - Horn remains one of the
    hottest receivers in the league with\n8 catches for 148 yards on Sunday.  With
    Aaron Brooks making wiser\ndecisions, the New Orleans offense has started putting
    touchdowns on the\nboard.  Although this may be bad news for John Carney owners,
    it is good\nnews for Horn, Ricky Williams, and Willie Jackson.\n\nWR - Jerry Rice
    - With Tim Brown receiving the majority of attention from\ndefenses, Rice will
    continue to be effective on the other side of the field.\nThe career touchdown
    leader added 3 more to his total on Sunday and made it\nlook rather easy.  With
    the Oakland offense looking good, Rice should\ncontinue to see scoring chances.
    \ A good option for a 3rd wide receiver in\nyour lineup.\n\nWR - Peerless Price
    - With 10 catches and 138 yards receiving on Sunday,\nPrice continues to outperform
    Eric Moulds in the Bills offense and have many\nfantasy owners questioning who
    is the number one receiver in Buffalo.  With\nEric Moulds being shut down with
    double teams, Price has quietly scored 5\ntouchdowns on the season.  Price is
    a talented receiver and should continue\nto score a touchdown every other week.\n\nWR
    - Hines Ward - Ward has amassed 26 catches in his last 3 games. He has\nonly scored
    two touchdowns on the season, but his reception and yardage\nnumbers are becoming
    a consistent factor on a weekly basis.  I've never been\na big fan of the Steelers
    passing game, but Ward deserves consideration for\nactive duty on a weekly basis.\n\nWR
    - David Boston - Boston's 100-yard game streak ended this week.  Fantasy\nowners
    had to settle for 80 yards receiving and 2 touchdowns.  Look for\nBoston to continue
    to put up quality numbers.\n\n\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\n\n\nDowngrades\n\n\nQB
    - Brian Griese - The ankle injury to Rod Smith had me worried a little\nbit heading
    into Sunday's game, so I was not surprised by Griese's poor\nperformance on Sunday.
    \ With Smith hobbled by injuries and McCaffrey out for\nthe year, Griese's receiving
    options were limited and his production was\ndirectly affected.  You may want
    to consider benching Griese until Smith is\nhealthy.  However, the Broncos do
    play Dallas on Thanksgiving.\n\nQB - Tim Couch - Couch threw 3 interceptions and
    was held to 144 passing\nyards against a stingy Ravens defense.  Couch should
    be considered a quality\nkeeper quarterback, but the Browns schedule will make
    Couch an inconsistent\nquarterback for the remainder of this season.  Couch should
    do well against\nCincinnati and Jacksonville, but struggle against New England,
    Green Bay and\nPittsburgh.\n\nQB - Mark Brunell - An injured quad injury kept
    Brunell out of the lineup\nthis week.  With an unfavorable matchup against Baltimore
    this week, it may\nbe best to start someone else this week.\n\nQB - Elvis Grbac
    - Grbac looked horrible with 4 interceptions on Sunday.\nThe week was not a total
    disappointment for Grbac as he threw 2 touchdown\npasses. The schedule looks favorable
    for Grbac, but he is struggling, which\nconcerns me.\n\nQB - Tony Banks - Banks
    suffered a concussion in Sunday's game against\nDenver.  The injury looked severe
    as Banks was slammed to the ground and\nthen taken off the field on a stretcher.\n\nQB
    - Jay Fiedler - Fiedler threw 3 interceptions and 2 touchdowns on Sunday.\nUnfortunately,
    Fiedler's two touchdowns were scored by the Jets defense.\nThe up and down season
    for Fiedler continues.  With games against Buffalo,\nIndianapolis and San Francisco
    left on the schedule, Fiedler should still be\nconsidered a quality \"spot starter\".\n\n\n\nRB
    - Eddie George - George was held to 61 yards on 23 carries Sunday.  He\nhas yet
    to break the 100-yard barrier in a game this season.  I guess the\ntoe injury
    in the preseason affected his performance more than most\nanticipated.  Although
    we can blame the toe injury, two other factors have\nmeant the demise of George
    this season.  First, the loss of lead back\nLorenzo Neal has minimized running
    lanes.  Finally, the Titans offensive\nline is not giving George the quality run
    blocking of the previous seasons.\n\nRB - Anthony Thomas - Thomas was held under
    60 yards for the second\nconsecutive game.  With opposing defenses focusing on
    stopping the run,\nThomas will continue to find the running room a little tougher
    throughout\nthe remainder of the season.  Keep in mind, the Bears last two opponents\n(Green
    Bay and Tampa Bay) are two of the better defenses against the run in\nthe league.
    \ With Tampa Bay, Green Bay, Minnesota and Detroit (2) on the\nschedule for the
    remainder of the season, expect Thomas' stats to be up and\ndown.\n\nRB - Lamar
    Smith - With 53 rushing yards on 19 carries, Smith continues to\nstruggle.  This
    marks the 5th consecutive game that Smith has been held 3\nyards/carry.  Don't
    be surprised if the Dolphins give Travis Minor a larger\nrole in the running game.\n\nRB
    - Travis Henry - Henry continues to struggle.  He managed just 29 yards\non 13
    carries this past Sunday and had a crucial fumble.  A running back can\nnot be
    productive with just 13 carries.  Keep him on your bench.\n\n\n\nWR - Rod Smith
    - Suffering from an ankle injury, Smith was limited to 25\nyards on three catches.
    \ He did manage to score a touchdown.  Smith's ankle\ninjury deserved your attention.
    \ The Broncos kept Smith on the sidelines\nlate in the 4th quarter while the team
    was attempting to drive down the\nfield and tie the ball game.  The short week
    will not help Smith's status on\nThanksgiving Day.\n\nWR - Eric Moulds - The disappointing
    season for Moulds continues.  He was\nheld to 61 yards on Sunday while Peerless
    Price gained 138 on the other side\nof the field.  Moulds may not even be the
    best fantasy option on the Bills\nat this point.\n\nWR - Wayne Chrebet - A shoulder
    injury to Chrebet limited his production on\nSunday.  Testaverde and the passing
    game isn't looking very good at this\npoint.  You may want to bench Chrebet until
    he is 100% healthy.\n\nWR - Todd Pinkston - Pinkston has become a regular on the
    downgrade list.\nHeck, I like the guy and think he could become special.  However,
    he remains\nto do what is needed....produce on a consistent basis.\n\nWR - Muhsin
    Muhammad - Muhammad suffered a sprained shoulder and was unable\nto play in the
    second half against San Francisco.  Heck, his production was\nnot missed.  It's
    pretty difficult to miss little to no production, if you\nknow what I mean.  If
    you're a Muhammad owner, you know what I mean.\n\nWR - Reggie Wayne - Wayne suffered
    a sprained knee on Sunday and his status\nis not yet known.  He has yet to do
    anything special this season, but his\nexpectations were fairly high, so I'll
    downgrade him\n\n\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\n\nWaiver
    Wire\n\n\nKeep in mind, the waiver wire analysis selections are based off of 12
    and 14\nteam leagues.\n\nQB - Alex Van Pelt - Van Pelt stepped in the lineup and
    looked good on\nSunday with 316 passing yards and two touchdowns.  He has a talented\nreceiving
    crew with Moulds, Price and Riemersma.  As long as he can get pass\nprotection,
    his production could be a welcome addition to fantasy teams in\nneed of a quarterback.\n\nRB
    - Ben Gay - Gay was the feature back on Sunday with 18 carries for 56\nyards and
    a touchdown against a quality Baltimore Ravens defense.  No other\nrunning back
    has taken over the reigns of the Browns rushing offense.  Gay\nmay just be that
    guy.\n\nRB - Amos Zeroue - Although he suffered a sprained shoulder against the\nBrowns,
    Zeroue is expected to return to the team this week against\nJacksonville.  If
    you have Jerome Bettis on your team, Zeroue deserves a\nroster spot.  If not,
    you may want to take a flyer on this guy.  The\nSteelers have a solid running
    game and an injury to Bettis would open the\ndoor for Zeroue to produce quality
    numbers.\n\nRB - Lamont Jordan - Jordan is in a similar situation as Zeroue.  If
    Curtis\nMartin gets injured, Jordan would enter the lineup and produce quality\nnumbers.
    \ Not a bad option, if you can spare a roster spot.  If you have\nCurtis Martin,
    get Lamont Jordan.\n\nWR - JJ Stokes - Stokes looked good on Sunday with 72 yards
    and a touchdown.\nThis marks the second consecutive game with 72 yards.  With
    the 49ers\nlooking good in the passing game, a healthy Stokes could be a decent
    \"spot\nstarter\".\n\nWR - Keith Poole - Poole was unable to do anything on Sunday
    against the\nRedskins.  However, he continues to learn the offense and should
    start\nproducing very shortly.  Poole's effectiveness will most likely occur with
    a\nhealthy Rod Smith garnering double/triple teams on the opposite side of the\nfield.\n\nTE
    - \"Boo\" Williams - \"Boo\" has me excited about his potential.  He's a big,\nfast
    tight end with good hands.  Plain and simple, he has big play potential\nand should
    produce in the Saints offense.\n\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\n\nBryant

    Fla. -- Jacksonville Jaguars receiver Jimmy Smith tested\npositive for cocaine
    after police stopped him Nov. 11 on suspicion of\ndrunken driving, but he will
    not be prosecuted.\n\nSmith could face disciplinary action from the NFL for violating
    the league's\nsubstance abuse policy.\n\nNFL spokesman Dan Masonson said the league
    was reviewing Smith's case.\n\nSmith denied having taken cocaine, and said he
    was trying to figure out how\nthe test could have returned positive.\n\n\"I've
    never done it, don't do it and don't plan to do it,\" Smith said. \"I\njust hate

    Smith told him he did not take cocaine.\n\n\"This is a person I've had a long
    relationship with,\" Coughlin said. \"He\nlooks me in the eye and tells me he

    he was stopped, but police took a urine\nsample, which was sent to the Florida
    Department of Law Enforcement for\nanalysis.\n\nSmith tested positive for cocaine,
    Assistant State Attorney John Guy said\nMonday.\n\nGuy said his office would not
    prosecute Smith for drunken driving because he\ndid not have a blood-alcohol level
    above the state's .08 limit. Smith also\nwill not be prosecuted on drug charges.\n\n\"He
    didn't have anything on his person when he was arrested,\" Guy said.\n\"There
    was only cocaine in his system, and for that I can't prosecute.\"\n\nSmith, who
    has been to the last four Pro Bowls, was third in the AFC in\nreceptions with
    70 this season -- one in which most people didn't think he\nwould play.\n\nHe
    had three abdominal operations in the off-season, lost about 20 pounds\nand spent

    to wait to see how it\nshakes out.   Tough news all the way around but it's still
    very unclear what\n(if any) action the league will take.   More as we hear it.\n\nJoe\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\nBryant

  body: ! "\nFrom: \tChoate, Heather  \nSent:\tMonday, November 26, 2001 8:51 AM\nCc:\tBates,
    Kimberly; Hogan, Irena D.; Villarreal, Alex; Rangel, Ina; Vuittonet, Laura; Jackson,
    Brandee; Saldana, Alex; Superty, Robert; Hall, Bob M; Presas, Jessica; Quezada,

    Patti; Calcagno, Suzanne; Farmer, Daren J.; Smith, George F.; Olinger, Kimberly
    S.; Jaquet, Tammy; Young, Becky\nSubject:\tLogistics Commercial Realignment\n\n\nAfter
    a careful review of the wholesale and retail gas trading and scheduling process
    it has been decided that the Gas Logistics teams should report directly into the
    Enron America's Commercial organization. This realignment will help to strengthen
    the commercial focus and communication between the trading desks and the schedulers
    and will play a critical role as Enron tries to maximize opportunities and maintain
    a competitive trading edge. The details are as follows:\n\nWholesale\n\nBob Superty
    will maintain his management of the Logistics support functions which include
    the Transport Rate team (Kim Olinger), Electronic Commerce team (Tammy Lee-Jaquet)
    and Regulatory Affairs teams (Suzanne Calcagno). In addition, Bob will now manage
    the Northeast Logistics team as part of the East desk. Bob will report directly
    to Scott Neal and will also help coordinate the Logistics function across all
    regions working closely with each of the regional Logistics Managers, Commercial
    desk heads and Enron Americas senior management team. \n\nVictor LaMadrid will
    manage the Southeast Logistics team and will report directly to Scott Neal. Victor's
    knowledge and overall east desk experience will be critical to help  maximize
    east desk opportunities and promote new initiatives across all regions. \n\nLisa
    Kinsey will manage the Central Logistics team and will report directly to Hunter
    Shively.\n\nPatti Sullivan will manage the West Logistics team and will report
    directly to Mike Grigsby.\n\nDarren Farmer will manage the Texas Logistics team
    and will report directly to Tom Martin \n\nGeorge Smith will manage the Well Head
    Logistics team and will report directly to Fred Lagrasta.  \n\nRetail \n\nDonna
    Greif will now report directly to Don Black. Each of the regional Logistics Managers
    (East - Marde Driscoll-Ernest, Central - Charlie Muzzy, West - Sabra Dinari) will
    continue to report directly to Donna. Donna will continue her ongoing efforts
    in the development and integration of the new retail trading systems, prior period
    adjustments and development of a strong and talented Logistics team.  \n\n\nCongratulations
    to all involved and welcome to the commercial gas team - John Lavorato, President
    and CEO, Enron Americas.\n _____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
    \n\nAssistants - Please forward on to your groups. \n\n\n"

    OF ENERGY SUPPLY BACK ON THE EUROPEAN POLITICAL AGENDA\n\nThe tragic events of
    September 11 brought a new dimension to the general \nquestion of security--clearly
    energy facilities could be targets for terrorist \nattacks. Even before the attacks,
    high world oil prices and the euro's \ndepreciation put energy security of supply
    back on the European political \nagenda, together with the awareness of dependence
    on imports, and the risk of \neconomic and even physical disruption in energy
    supply, including natural \ndisruptions from storms or flooding.\n\n*  Security
    of supply, under its different forms, has returned as a political \nconcern across
    the European Union.\n\n*  The new liberalized environment should, at least partly,
    mitigate security \nsupply risks.\n\n*  Long-term risks remain a matter of discussion,
    with concern that market \nmechanisms provide the right signals, such as adequate
    investment made at the \nright time.\n\n**end**\n\nFollow above URL for complete

  subject: Forbes Article-Gas Fired Power Plants
  body: ! "Don't know if you saw this already.  Interesting.\n\nKen\n\nIndigestion
    \nDaniel Fisher, Forbes Magazine, 10.29.01 \n\nAll those new natural gas-fired
    electric plants mean more gas demand, right? Maybe not.\nFor natural gas bulls,
    there was never a surer sign of good times to come than the order book at General
    Electric Corp. Backlogs in GE's Power Systems group almost tripled to $25 billion
    in the late 1990s as scores of utilities and freestanding power producers ordered
    natural gas turbines to supply the nation's growing appetite for electricity.
    Gas demand had to go up as all those shiny new turbines were connected to the
    grid. \n\nAh, but there was a flaw in that argument--one that is becoming glaringly
    clear as the price of gas plunges below $2 per million Btu at the wellhead from
    as high as $10 last year. (A million Btu of gas equals just about 1,000 cubic
    feet.) Those new gas plants were supposed to steal business from pollution-spewing
    coal units, which still supply half the nation's electricity. But in a painstaking
    study of 788 power plants that supply the bulk of U.S. electricity, Charles Studness,
    president of Studness Research, found quite the opposite could happen. \n\nStudness
    determined that 79% of the \"new\" electricity supplied to the grid over the past
    five years came from existing plants, mostly coal-fired units. And there's plenty
    more where that came from. Studness figures existing coal plants have the potential
    to increase output by 50 million megawatt-hours a year for the next five years,
    representing about half the expected 2.5%-a-year increase in demand. \n\nCoal's
    advantage over gas: It's cheap. Utilities paid an average of $1.20 per million
    Btu for coal last year, compared with $4.30 for gas (delivered). Even with depressed
    gas prices, many coal plants are still cheaper to operate. So while those new
    turbines being installed by Calpine (nyse: CPN - news - people) and other independent
    power producers, (see table, below) will burn a lot of gas, they will do it mostly
    at the expense of older gas plants that burn half again as much. \n\n \nAddressing
    a Burning Issue \nIf natural gas prices stay down or merely remain volatile it
    will help companies that burn, trade or store gas and hurt those that sell it
    or provide equipment to the industry. Overleveraged gas producers and service
    companies could have trouble making it through the downturn.  \n  \n\nWINNERS

    12 months. Source: Market Guide via FactSet Research Systems. \n\n\"It's not our
    game to compete with coal or nuclear,\" says Ron A. Walter, senior vice president
    of San Jose, Calif.-based Calpine, which plans over the next few years to build
    gas-fired plants totaling 31,500 megawatts. \"It's our game to displace older
    gas.\" \n\nCombined-cycle gas turbines, which use hot exhaust gases from one turbine
    to generate steam to turn a second one, can transform 6,800 Btu of gas into a
    kilowatt-hour of electricity, enough to light one lightbulb for ten hours. The
    oldest gas plants burn as much as 13,000 Btu, and the national average is 10,500.
    Substitute enough new plants for old, and U.S. gas consumption, currently 62 billion
    cubic feet a day, could drop by as much as 1 billion cubic feet a day. \n\nThat
    scenario sounds unlikely to Stephen Bergstrom, president of Houston-based Dynegy,
    an energy-trading firm that also owns both coal- and gas-fired power plants. Dynegy's
    35-year-old coal plants are \"huge capital hogs,\" Bergstrom says, that cost ten
    times as much to maintain as modern gas units. Throw in the cost of scrubbers
    and other required pollution controls, and many smaller coal plants will have
    to be shut down, Bergstrom says. \n\nBut coal-plant owners can be ingenious. Witness
    Midwest Generation, a nonregulated subsidiary of Edison International that bought
    six coal plants from troubled Commonwealth Edison of Chicago in 1999. By changing
    operating procedures and burning a higher grade of coal, Midwest boosted output
    from the 40-year-old plants 12% last year--while reducing emissions. John Long,
    vice president and chief technical officer of the Midwest Generation unit, thinks
    he can coax another 15% increase out of those aging boilers over the next five
    years without running afoul of environmental rules. \n\nLong term, the bullish
    scenario still holds: Gas will displace coal. In the meantime, gas producers have
    a lot of bonds to retire. \n\n\n"

  subject: ! '[Footballguys] Update # 128 10-18 Week 6 Passing Matchups'
  body: ! "\nHi Folks,\n\nHere's how I see the matchups this week.\n\nPLEASE NOTE:
    \  See the cheatsheets online at www.footballguys.com  for\nexactly where I rank
    players and to determine who to start.   I always\nreceive emails asking me how
    I can have a guy ranked highly on the\ncheatsheet but listed under a matchup that
    favors the Defense.   Just\nbecause one matchup may be more favorable than another,
    that doesn't\nnecessarily mean I'd start the player with the best matchup.   Peyton\nManning
    may have a horrible matchup one week but unless you're sitting on\nKurt Warner
    or Daunte Culpepper, Manning's your guy no matter who he's\nlining up against.
    \  The matchup info is meant to be just one more tool in\nyour box when it comes
    to deciding between players.\n\nNote:  I've used the player stats sorted by performance
    over the last four\nweeks extensively in developing these write-ups. Stats are
    provided by Mike\nHall's excellent FLM League Management Software.  http://www.fflm.com/
    for\nmore info.\nLet's get to it.\n\nJoe\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\n\nLocks:
    \ These games feature Defenses that should be overmatched against the\nOffense.\n\n\nNew
    Orleans Passing Game vs Atlanta Defense\n\nA good dose of the Atlanta Defense
    may be just what New Orleans and QB Aaron\nBrooks needed.   The Falcons are awful
    ranking # 31 in Passing Yards Allowed\nPer Game over the last four weeks.   They
    rank # 29 in Fantasy Points\nAllowed to QBs.   Brooks will be throwing to WRs
    Joe Horn and Willie\nJackson.   Albert Connell is there but not a big factor.
    \  Of course, the\nbiggest news from last week was the awakening of TE Cam Cleeland.
    \  He could\nplay a big role if he get's fired up.\n\n\nGreen Bay Passing Game
    vs Minnesota Defense\n\nYou have little choice but to start Brett Favre.   Last
    week, he hung 3 TDs\non the Ravens so I think he can handle the Vikings.   WR
    Antonio Freeman\nawoke from a slumber and did it in a big way.   The question
    of the week is\ncan he continue?   Part of his success can be attributed to his
    public\ndemand for more passes (which Favre said he approved of and made good
    on his\npromises to target Freeman more)   Although an ankle injury to WR Bill\nSchroeder
    was no doubt a factor as well.   It looks like Schroeder will play\nbut the ankle
    is still sore.   If Schroeder can go, both look to be a good\nstart against the
    Viking's defense ranked # 28 in Passing Yards Allowed Per\nGame over the last
    four weeks.   They're also # 28 in Fantasy Points Allowed\nto WRs.   TE Bubba
    Franks is a must start as it seems every pass he catches\nis for a TD.\n\n\nJacksonville
    Passing Game vs Buffalo Defense\n\nAfter a hot start, it seems like it's been
    forever since the Jaguars have\nscored a passing TD.   That should change this
    week as they face a soft\nBuffalo Defense that ranks # 25 in Passing Yards Allowed
    Per Game over the\nlast four weeks.   They're even worse when it comes to Fantasy
    Points\nAllowed to QBs ranking # 28.   Pretty much all the Jaguar skill positions\nlook
    good here.   WRs Jimmy Smith and Keenan McCardell are must starts.\nThey'll be
    too much for Cornerbacks Ken Irvin and Antoine Winfield.   TE\nKyle Brady is a
    nice play here too.   He was the target of 5 passes in week\n4.\n\n\nKansas City
    Passing Game vs Arizona Defense\n\nA game against Arizona may be just what the
    disappointing Chiefs need.\nTrent Green's been nowhere near as good as everyone
    (including us) hoped but\nI'm not sure it's all his fault.   He's had trouble
    keeping a WR Corps\nhealthy and teams are doubling and tripling TE Tony Gonzalez,
    their best\nplayer.   Priest Holmes has put a spark in the running game and that'll\nhelp.
    \  WR Derrick Alexander only caught one pass last week but he had 8\nthrown his
    way so he's getting the opportunities.   He'll likely make much\nbetter use of
    his chances this week against a Cardinal team that ranks # 22\nin Passing Yards
    Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   They rank # 26\nin Fantasy Points
    Allowed to QBs so Green could break out as well.\n\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\n\nPrime
    Matchups:  These games feature Defenses that should have trouble\nstopping the
    Offense.\n\n\nTennessee Passing Game vs Detroit Defense\n\nSteve McNair awoke
    last week and played a very solid game against Tampa Bay\nthrowing for 230 yards
    and 1 TD.   He'll have a much easier time this week\nagainst a Lion team that's
    hurting in the secondary.   Detroit ranks # 13 in\nPassing Yards Allowed Per Game
    over the last four weeks but they're\nvulnerable.  They rank # 29 in Fantasy Points
    Allowed to WRs.   WR Kevin\nDyson is probably the best bet for WRs.   Derrick
    Mason is still nursing a\nbad ankle and his status isn't clear yet.   Chris Sanders
    could see time too\nand he's been targeted some lately.   Of course, the favorite
    receiver is\nstill TE Frank Wycheck.\n\n\nSt. Louis Passing Game vs New York Jets
    Defense\n\nJust start your Rams.   Warner, Holt, Bruce and probably Hakim and
    TE\nConwell all deserve starting status.   Until I see it again, I'm calling the\nGiants
    game of last week an aberration.   The Jets defense ranks # 20 in\nPassing Yards
    Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks but I'd start these\nguys against the
    AFC Pro Bowl Team.\n\n\nPittsburgh Passing Game vs Tampa Bay Defense\n\nThis could
    be an ugly game for the Steeler passing game.   Tampa plays\nprimarily zone defense
    which means Stewart will be forced to pick his spots\nfrom the pocket.   And we
    all know, the pocket is no friend to Stewart who\nis best when he can run a little.
    \  Man coverage allows a QB more freedom to\ntuck and run with defenders in coverage.
    \  He will face a tough Defense with\nthe talent to hold down WRs Hines Ward and
    Plaxico Burress.   On the plus\nside, Tampa's given up a lot of yards to the passing
    game though ranking #\n30 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four
    weeks.   They rank #\n23 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs so the potential is
    there for Stewart to\ndo something, I'm just not sure what it'll be .\n\n\nCarolina
    Passing Game vs Washington Defense\n\nQB Chris Weinke gets better each week.   Is
    he playing well enough to carry\nyour team right now?   Probably not.   But he
    might start getting there.\nThe Redskins  rank # 24 in Passing Yards Allowed Per
    Game over the last four\nweeks.   Weinke's primary targets will be WR Muhsin Muhammad
    and TE Wesley\nWalls.   Both should have decent opportunities this week.   On
    the upside,\nWashington Cornerback Fred Smoot will likely be limited if he even
    plays\nwith a bad knee.\n\n\nDenver Passing Game vs San Diego Defense\n\nQB Brian
    Griese has complained of shoulder pain all week and missed early\npractices but
    says he'll play Sunday.   Gus Frerotte will go if Griese\ncan't.   Good luck getting
    a straight answer out of Skeletor Shanahan (love\nthat guy) but if I had to guess,
    I'd play him.   Weigh it out though if you\nhave another solid option of course.
    \  The Chargers are looking suddenly\nvery beatable after New England's Tom Brady
    hung 364 yards and 2 TDs on\nthem.   The key will be Eddie Kennison staying on
    a roll.   He takes the\nincredible pressure off Rod Smith and can stretch the
    defense keeping Safety\nRodney Harrison back where he belongs and off the line.
    \  San Diego ranks #\n18 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four
    weeks but can\ndefinitely be thrown on.\n\n\nDetroit Passing Game vs Tennessee
    Defense\n\nWhat got into Charlie Batch?   Whatever it is, let's hope he can keep
    it up.\nHe posted some great numbers last week with 345 yards, 3 TDs and most\nimportantly,
    0 interceptions.   He'll try to keep it rolling against a\nsuspect Titan defense
    that's ranked # 27 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game\nover the last four weeks.
    \  They're ranked # 24 in Fantasy Points Allowed to\nQBs.   Cornerback Samari
    Rolle is out again and that hurts.   Germane\nCrowell may not know when to run
    out of bounds but he can rack up the yards.\nLook for him to do it again.   Johnnie
    Morton will man the other spot and do\nwell.   In minor news, it looks like Herman
    Moore is done for the year with\na torn muscle in his hip.\n\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\n\nEven
    Matchups:  These games feature no real advantage either way\n\n\nWashington Passing
    Game vs Carolina Defense\n\nAre you really down to this?   If so, Tony Banks may
    be ok this week.\nCarolina ranks # 26 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the
    last four\nweeks.   And they're the worst team in the league in Fantasy Points
    Allowed\nto QBs.   Still though, I hate to think I'm putting too much faith in
    these\nguys.   WR Rod Gardner is getting more looks than anyone at this point.\nMichael
    Westbrook scored last week and maybe he can build on that.   TE\nStephen Alexander
    is out with a bad ankle.\n\n\nSan Diego Passing Game vs Denver Defense\n\nFlutie's
    fun to watch but make sure to understand this team is about RB\nLaDainian Tomlinson.
    \  I hear some comparisons to Denver's John Elway\nfinding a young Terrell Davis
    but this isn't the same.   Flutie just won't\nput up the stats consistently.   Curtis
    Conway, Tim Dwight and Jeff Graham\nare all seeing about the same amount of work
    and that makes it tough to pick\none.   Unfortunately, TE Freddie Jones has been
    very inconsistent and\nfrustrating for his owners.   I'm not sure that will change.
    \  The Broncos\nare pretty solid against the pass ranking # 12 in Passing Yards
    Allowed Per\nGame over the last four weeks.  They rank # 11 in Fantasy Points
    Allowed to\nQBs.\n\n\nPhiladelphia Passing Game vs New York Giants Defense\n\nWith
    a week off to prepare, look for the Eagles to come out firing.\nSomewhat like
    Green Bay did last week against Baltimore, look for them to\nfocus on the pass
    against a defense that is extremely good against the run.\nThey'll have their
    work cut out for them though.   The Giants pass defense\nhas been up and down.
    \  Of course, lately, they've been very up holding the\nhigh flying Rams to a
    mere mortal 15 points and no passing TDs.   That's\nstrong.   But they rank just
    # 18 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the\nlast four weeks.   They're a
    little tougher on QBs ranking # 10 in Fantasy\nPoints Allowed to QBs.   Donovan
    McNabb has two solid under rated WRs in\nTodd Pinkston and James Thrash that can
    stretch the field.   TE Chad Lewis\nhas been seeing a lot of balls thrown his
    way and could do damage here.\n\n\nNew England Passing Game vs Indianapolis Defense\n\nTom
    Brady continues to impress as he gains confidence in the system.   He'll\ngo against
    the Colts this week who have to be wondering where their Super\nBowl aspirations
    have gone.   The key in my opinion is WR Terry Glenn who\nbrings an entirely new
    dimension to this team.   Brady threw the ball his\nway 14 times last week.   Troy
    Brown is a quiet option but he gets a ton of\ntargets (16 last week)   The Colts
    rank # 14 in Passing Yards Allowed Per\nGame over the last four weeks but rank
    # 8 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs.\n\n\nChicago Passing Game vs Cincinnati
    Defense\n\nI'm looking for Jim Miller to bounce back from an awful game last week\nagainst
    Arizona.   The Bengal defense is pretty solid ranking # 8 in Passing\nYards Allowed
    Per Game over the last four weeks.   They'll be without\nCornerback Rodney Heath.
    \  Corner Robert Bean is probable with a leg injury\nso he's likely less than
    100%.   The Bengals rank # 18 in Fantasy Points\nAllowed to QBs so that's some
    encouragement.   WR Marcus Robinson will have\na size advantage on the Bengal
    Corners and watch for Marty Booker who was\nthe target of more passes last week
    than was Robinson.\n\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\n\nDownside
    Matchups:  These games feature a Defense that could pose trouble\nfor the Offense.\n\n\nNew
    York Jets Passing Game vs St. Louis Defense\n\nWith every passing week, it becomes
    more and more clear that this \"new\"\noffense is really just a slightly different
    way to get Curtis Martin the\nball.   And that's the smart move for Jet's fans.
    \  Vinny Testeverde draws a\npretty tough matchup this week in the Rams who rank
    # 9 in Passing Yards\nAllowed Per Game over the last four weeks.  They rank #
    19 in in Fantasy\nPoints Allowed to QBs.   Laveranues Coles has been getting plenty
    of looks\nand is a good play.   Wayne Chrebet will handle the intermediate stuff
    as he\nalways does.\n\n\nAtlanta Passing Game vs New Orleans Defense\n\nChris
    Chandler still has plenty left in the tank (as long as he can protect\nhis head)
    \  The Saints could cause trouble with an aggressive blitzing\ndefense that's
    recorded 12 sacks already.   That Super Dome floor isn't much\nsofter than the
    carpet covered concrete of the Georgia Dome so injury is\nalways a worry.   New
    Orleans is tough ranking # 11 in Passing Yards Allowed\nPer Game over the last
    four weeks.   They rank # 13 in Fantasy Points\nAllowed to QBs.   Look for Chandler
    to focus on Terance Mathis and Shawn\nJefferson as he did last week although Jefferson
    is risky listed as\nquestionable with ankle / toe problems.\n\n\nBuffalo Passing
    Game vs Jacksonville Defense\n\nWill the week off benefit Rob Johnson?   I really
    don't know.   You know by\nnow that I'm down on Johnson.   He does have two potentially
    very good WRs\nthough in Eric Moulds and Peerless Price.   Both have underachieved
    this\nseason and it's hard to know whether to blame them or Johnson.\nJacksonville
    is average defending the pass ranking # 15 in Passing Yards\nAllowed Per Game
    over the last four weeks.   They're much tougher in\nshutting down QBs though
    as they rank # 2 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs.\nCornerback Fernando Bryant
    is Questionable with a bad foot and that'll be a\nbig plus for the Bills if he
    can't go.\n\n\nCincinnati Passing Game vs Chicago Defense\n\nIt may not seem like
    a big deal, but the Bengals will miss WR Chad Johnson\nwho's out with a broken
    collarbone.   He was a true deep threat that took\nheat off of Darnay Scott and
    freed up Peter Warrick underneath.   We'll see\nhow they work without him.   Jon
    Kitna continues to play a Trent Dilfer like\n\"good enough to win\" game and I
    don't see that changing a lot.   The Bengals\nwould love to get games like last
    week's 201 yard, 1 TD and 0 interception\n(the biggie) out of Kitna.   This offense
    is all about RB Corey Dillon.\nThe Bears are tougher against the run than they
    are the pass.   Chicago\nranks # 19 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the
    last four weeks.\nThey bring a tough pass rush with 11 sacks in their last 3 games.
    \  All in\nall, a pretty tough matchup.\n\n\nCleveland Passing Game vs Baltimore
    Defense\n\nGreen Bay showed last week one way to beat Baltimore was to concede
    the\nrunning game and focus on throwing the ball.   That's fine as long as you\nhave
    Brett Favre under center.   Tim Couch may one day be very good, but\nhe's a long
    ways from Favre today.   The Ravens rank # 10 in Passing Yards\nAllowed Per Game
    over the last four weeks so they can be thrown on.   Kevin\nJohnson has been hot
    for the Browns and Quincy Morgan is getting almost as\nmany balls thrown his way
    as Johnson.   The Ravens bring two very good\nCornerbacks in Duane Starks and
    Chris McAlister that'll make it a tough game\nfor the Browns.\n\n\nIndianapolis
    Passing Game vs New England Defense\n\nIf you can afford to bench Peyton Manning,
    you're deep enough at QB that you\ndon't need our help.   The Patriots are pretty
    tough ranking # 7 in Passing\nYards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.
    \  They also rank # 6 in\nFantasy Points Allowed to QBs.   I'd still start Manning
    unless I had a\ngreat option though.   He's just too liable to have a great game
    against\nanyone.   Same for Marvin Harrison.   Jerome Pathon is still very iffy
    for\nthis week and I'd avoid.   Rookie Reggie Wayne is still learning the ropes\nand
    had 3 passes thrown his way last week.  I'm not counting on a whole lot\nyet from
    him.\n\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\n\nDefensive Slam
    Dunks:  These games feature a very tough Defense posing major\nproblems for the
    Offense.\n\n\nTampa Bay Passing Game vs Pittsburgh Defense\n\nMust be something
    in the Nashville water that awoke both Steve McNair and\nBrad Johnson last week.
    \  Johnson finally listened to Keyshawn and threw him\nthe ball 17 times Sunday.
    \  Both Johnsons had strong games and hopefully the\nlight flicked on for Brad
    Johnson.   Jacquez Green had several looks but\nclearly, this is a Johnson and
    Johnson team now.   The Steelers are very\ntough against the pass ranking # 3
    in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over\nthe last four weeks.   They rank # 3 in
    Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs as\nwell so it's pretty clear that it's a tough
    matchup for the Bucs.\n\n\nNew York Giants Passing Game vs Philadelphia Defense\n\nAfter
    a heartbreaking loss to the Rams, the Giants face a very tough Eagle\npass defense
    that's ranked # 1 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the\nlast four weeks.
    \  They rank # 5 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs so it'll\nbe tough going for
    the Giants here.   QB Kerry Collins hasn't been anything\nspecial lately and look
    for the Eagles to continue their huge array of\nblitzes that they love.   He'll
    be throwing to Amani Toomer who needs to\npick up the pace he started with early.
    \  Ike Hilliard is back but still not\nseeing as many passes thrown his way as
    Joe Jurevicius.\n\n\nMinnesota Passing Game vs Green Bay Defense\n\nFor all the
    anti Viking talk, Culpepper continues to post some excellent\nFantasy Stats.   His
    rushing TDs are huge in many scoring systems.   Of\ncourse, the big question this
    week is the health of Randy Moss' ankle.\nCoach Denny Green came out this week
    and said Moss has been limited by the\neffects of his ankle sprain suffered before
    his rookie season.   I\npersonally would come up with something better than that...
    \  Denny Green is\na player's coach and it wouldn't surprise me at all if this
    were primarily a\nprotection move for his star WR.   I'd fully expect Moss to
    play but\ncertainly, he's a risk.   The Packers are very tough against the pass\nranking
    # 4 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.\nThey're also
    # 4 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs.   With RB Michael Bennett\nout this week,
    the Vikings will likely be throwing all day so you know\nthey'll be getting the
    opportunities.   It's a very tough matchup though.\n\n\nArizona Passing Game vs
    Kansas City Defense\n\nPlummer's always a roll of the dice and this week isn't
    any different.\nHe'll face a KC defense that's very tough statistically against
    the pass\nranking # 3 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.\nWhen
    it comes to Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs, they rank # 7.   David\nBoston is clearly
    Plummer's best option and he'll match up pretty well with\nthe Chiefs.  MarTay
    Jenkins and Frank Sanders will see some action but\nyou'll be hard pressed to
    start them I'd think.   Probably a risky matchup\nthis week for a Cardinal team
    that's suspect in talent to begin with.\n\n\nBaltimore Passing Game vs Cleveland
    Defense\n\nElvis Grbac returned back to reality last week with a disappointing
    game\nagainst the Packers.   He was held to 138 yards, 1 TD and 2 Interceptions\nalso
    suffering a neck injury / concussion.   He's listed as probable and\nshould improve
    upon those numbers this week but not by a lot.   The Browns\nare tough against
    the pass ranking # 6 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game\nover the last four weeks.
    \  More impressively, they rank # 1 in Fantasy\nPoints Allowed to QBs.   Cornerbacks
    Daylon McCutcheon and Corey Fuller\nshould do a pretty nice job of matching up
    with WRs Travis Taylor and Qadry\nIsmail.   Of course, Shannon Sharpe is always
    a threat.   Bottom line, this\nis a tough matchup for Baltimore.\n\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\n\nBryant

    Folks,\n\nHere's how I see the Rushing Game Matchups this week.\n\nPLEASE NOTE:
    \  See the cheatsheet online at  www.footballguys.com for\nexactly where I rank
    players and to determine who to start.   I always\nreceive emails asking me how
    I can have a guy ranked highly on the\ncheatsheet but listed under a matchup that
    favors the Defense.   Just\nbecause one matchup may be more favorable than another,
    that doesn't\nnecessarily mean I'd start the player with the best matchup.   Ahman
    Green\nmay have a horrible matchup one week but unless you're sitting on Edgerrin\nJames
    or Marshall Faulk, Green's your guy no matter who he's lining up\nagainst.   The
    matchup info is meant to be just one more tool in your box\nwhen it comes to deciding
    between players.\n\nStats are provided by Mike Hall's excellent FLM League Management
    Software.\nhttp://www.fflm.com/ for more info.   Fantasy Points Allowed by position\nnumbers
    are from ESPN.com.\nLet's get to it.\n\nJoe\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\n\nLocks:
    \ These games feature Defenses that should be overmatched against the\nOffense.\n\n\nKansas
    City's Priest Holmes vs Arizona Defense\n\nThe bright spot for the Chiefs offense
    was Holmes last week as he rolled up\n150 yards on 20 carries for a 7.5 ypc average
    plus 2 TDs.   Not a bad day\nagainst a very good Pittsburgh defense.   This week,
    it'll be considerably\neasier against the Cardinals.   Arizona ranks # 27 in Rushing
    Yards Allowed\nper Game over the last four weeks and # 29 in Fantasy Points Allowed
    to RBs.\nThey make everyone look good and that likely won't change this week.\nThere's
    also a chance Tony Richardson could play this week\n\n\nSt. Louis' Trung Canidate
    / Marshall Faulk vs New York Jets Defense\n\nFaulk owners had quite a scare this
    week.   Over a 24 hour period, his\ninjury status went from 4 weeks to 2 weeks
    to possibly playing in this\nweek's game.   To make matters more frustrating,
    the Jets are weak defending\nthe run ranking # 29 in Rushing Yards Allowed per
    Game over the last four\nweeks.  They're # 26 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.
    \  They did look\nbetter last week though but I still think they're very vulnerable.
    \  Trung\nCanidate will likely get the start and he could shine if given the\nopportunity.
    \  That system and surrounding cast is so good I'm not sure I\ncouldn't put decent
    numbers there.   If I had another option outside of\nFaulk, I'd probably go there
    as it's very risky to look for anything from\nhim.   If I had Canidate, this could
    be the game to start him.\n\n\nJacksonville's Stacey Mack / Frank Moreau / Elvis
    Joseph vs Buffalo Defense\n\nTough call of the week here.   With Fred Taylor still
    out, my guess is it'll\nbe Mack getting the start.   Until he fumbles or fails
    to produce.   Both of\nwhich have a pretty good chance of happening.   Then you'll
    see Frank Moreau\nand our guy Elvis Joseph.   You may see a good bit of Moreau
    anyway.   The\nfrustrating thing is that the Bills matchup is so attractive.   They
    rank #\n30 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks and # 28
    in\nFantasy Points Allowed to RBs.   I'd go with Mack if you're in the gambling\nmood
    as he just might pay off against that defense.\n\n\nArizona's Michael Pittman
    vs Kansas City Defense\n\nCheck Pittman's status this week as he's dealing with
    a concussion (that he\nplayed through during the game)   Early this week, he was
    still having\nheadaches but I'd be surprised if doesn't get the bulk of the carries.\nThomas
    Jones had only 6 carries for 14 yards last week and I don't see that\nchanging
    a lot.   Pittman ran for 50 yards on 16 carries (3.1 ypc) but the\nChicago defense
    is very tough.   This week, he'll face a much softer KC unit\nthat ranks just
    # 28 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four\nweeks.   When it comes
    to Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs, they rank # 20 for\nthe year.   I'm not too
    discouraged with last week's poor showing since the\nChicago D is very tough on
    the run and I think you may see Pittman perform\nbetter this week.\n\n\nCarolina's
    Tshimanga Biakabutuka / Richard Huntley vs Washington Defense\n\nIf you've been
    wondering if you should ever start Biakabutuka, here's your\nchance.   The Redskins
    rank # 31 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the\nlast four weeks.   They
    also are worst in the league in Fantasy Points\nAllowed to RBs.   On the flip
    side, Biakabutuka struggled against a tough\nNew Orleans defense last week gaining
    just 30 yards on 13 carries (2.3 ypc)\nThe biggest stat though was that he did
    have another fumble.   We've seen\nalready that Coach Seifert won't put up with
    much of that.   Bottom line is\nthat it's a great matchup but I seriously wonder
    about Biakabutuka's ability\nto capitalize on it.\n\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\n\nPrime
    Matchups:  These games feature Defenses that should have trouble\nstopping the
    Offense.\n\n\nTennessee's Eddie George vs Detroit Defense\n\nLook for Eddie George
    to build on his positive performance from last week\nwhere her rushed for 85 yards
    on 29 carries (2.9 ypc) against the Bucs.\nHe'll find the going easier against
    a Lion defense that ranks # 21 in\nRushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last
    four weeks.   They rank # 25 in\nFantasy Points Allowed to RBs.   They're improving,
    but clearly, they\nhaven't been able to stop many people.   George isn't his old
    self but he\nmay be getting there.   The improved play of QB Steve McNair was
    the big\nnews from last week and he needs to keep it rolling to take heat off
    the\nrunning game.\n\n\nBaltimore's Terry Allen / Jason Brookins vs Cleveland
    Defense\n\nJason Brookins is breathing down his neck but Allen's hanging pretty
    tough.\nThe veteran shows little signs of wearing down.   Against a very good
    Green\nBay defense last week, he ran for 75 yards on 18 carries (4.2 ypc)\nBrookins
    totaled 33 yards on 9 carries for 3.7 ypc but here's a very\ndisturbing stat for
    Allen owners.   As you can see from our Red Zone data\nhttp://www.footballguys.com/redzone1.htm
    , Brookins has gradually been\nseeing more and more Red Zone touches.   In week
    4, he had 8 rushes in the\nredzone compared to 2 for Allen.   Last week, he had
    4 red zone rushes while\nTerry Allen had zero  (Allen did have a pass thrown to
    him in the Red Zone).\nThe Cleveland Defense is below average ranking # 22 in
    Rushing Yards Allowed\nper Game over the last four weeks.  They're # 18 in Fantasy
    Points Allowed\nto RBs.   Clearly, Brian Billick has confidence in Brookins with
    the Red\nZone touches and that's a trend that's likely to continue.\n\n\nWashington's
    Stephen Davis vs Carolina Defense\n\nIf you've been hanging with Stephen Davis
    all season, you might as well give\nhim another shot here.   The Panthers are
    weak against the rush ranking # 25\nin Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the
    last four weeks.   They rank # 21\nin Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.   The Panthers
    will be forced to start a\nbanged up Linebacking corps that could be vulnerable.
    \  Davis ran well\nagainst the Cowboys totally 99 yards on 23 carries (4.3 ypc)
    but he needs to\nget in the endzone.   He might get that chance against Carolina.\n\n\nNew
    York's Tiki Barber / Ron Dayne vs Philadelphia Defense\n\nThis one is tough to
    call right now.   Barber did some running this week and\nis Probable to play.
    \  The game is Monday night though so he's got an extra\n30 hours or so to get
    ready.   Dayne looks to be ready to roll here and he\ncould do some damage against
    an overrated Eagle rush defense.   They have\nthe good reputation but in reality,
    they rank # 24 in Rushing Yards Allowed\nper Game over the last four weeks.   They
    rank # 22 in Fantasy Points\nAllowed to RBs so it's no fluke.   My best guess
    on Barber is that he'll\nplay a good bit.   I wouldn't be surprised to see the
    Giants look almost\nback to \"normal\" with Dayne and Barber.\n\n\nNew England's
    Antowain Smith vs Indianapolis Defense\n\nQB Tom Brady is improving every week
    and that's helping the running game.\nThis week they'll face one of the softer
    defenses in the league in Indy.\nThe Colts rank # 26 in Rushing Yards Allowed
    per Game over the last four\nweeks.   Even worse, when it comes to Fantasy Points
    Allowed to RBs, they\nrank # 30.   Smith will need all the help he can get.   Last
    week, he ran\nfor 36 yards on 15 carries (2.4 ypc) against San Diego.   Although
    the\nChargers are tough and he did get a TD.   Remember that Indy is the team\nthat
    got Smith rolling back in week three where he broke out with 94 yards\non 22 carries
    (4.3 ypc) and 2 TDs.   He's inconsistent but this is a good\nmatchup for Smith.\n\n\nGreen
    Bay's Ahman Green vs Minnesota Defense\n\nThe fast track of the Metrodome paired
    with the Viking defense should make\nfor a nice game from Green.   Last week,
    Green was held to just 54 yards on\n20 carries (2.7 ypc).   But that was against
    Baltimore.   Against a Viking\nteam that yielded 108 yards to James Stewart last
    week, I think Green will\nfare even better.   Statistically, the Vikings have
    been ok ranking # 15 in\nRushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks
    and # 15 in Fantasy\nPoints Allowed to RBs.   But this team is struggling.\n\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\n\nEven
    Matchups:  These games feature no real advantage either way\n\n\nSan Diego's LaDainian
    Tomlinson vs Denver Defense\n\nLaDainian Tomlinson enters this week as the # 4
    RB over the last 3 weeks.\nHe'll be facing a pretty tough Bronco defense ranked
    # 11 in Rushing Yards\nAllowed per Game over the last four weeks.   They're #
    12 in Fantasy Points\nAllowed to RBs.   Denver is tough between the tackles but
    Tomlinson has\nshown he has the speed and skill to break outside when he needs
    to.   San\nDiego knows Tomlinson is the key to their success and I expect them
    to lean\nheavily upon him.\n\n\nNew Orleans' Ricky Williams vs Atlanta Defense\n\nWilliams
    is playing as well as any RB in the game right now.   He's running\nhard and more
    importantly, he looks like he's having fun.   Don't\nunderestimate that angle
    for a guy like Ricky Williams.   The Falcon defense\nis decent ranking # 16 in
    Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four\nweeks.   They're a little tougher
    in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs where\nthey rank # 11.   I can't see benching
    him unless you're just totally loaded\nat RB.\n\n\nIndianapolis' Edgerrin James
    vs New England Defense\n\nPlay Edgerrin James.   You don't need me for that.   He
    rolled up 115 yards\non 26 carries (4.5 ypc) against Oakland Sunday night.   New
    England ranks #\n19 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks
    and # 24 in\nFantasy Points Allowed to RBs.   Start James.\n\n\nDetroit's James
    Stewart vs Tennessee Defense\n\nJames Stewart rolled last week against a weak
    Viking defense posting 108\nyards on just 16 carries (6.1 ypc)   This week, he'll
    face a definitely\nbeatable Tennessee defense that ranks # 18 in Rushing Yards
    Allowed per Game\nover the last four weeks.   They're even more vulnerable if
    you look at\nFantasy Points Allowed to RBs where they rank # 27.   QB Charlie
    Batch\nplayed a great game last week and he'll go a long ways toward helping\nStewart's
    numbers although this team does seem more interested in throwing\nthe ball than
    they do in letting Stewart control the ground game.\n\n\nBuffalo's Travis Henry
    vs Jacksonville Defense\n\nTravis Henry's had a week to rest and get's the national
    stage to prove\nhimself on Thursday night.   Jacksonville's defense has been up
    and down\nthis year.   They rank # 20 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the
    last\nfour weeks.   LB Hardy Nickerson is still Questionable with his neck injury.\nIf
    he can't go, that'll surely be a plus for Henry.   Even without\nNickerson, they've
    been pretty tough only allowing 4 TDs in the last 4\ngames.   I think everyone
    pretty much agrees Rob Johnson isn't going to\ncarry this team now so look for
    Coach Gregg Williams to see if Henry can\nshoulder the load.   Keep an eye on
    his knee situation as he's had a nagging\nsoreness that the docs are diagnosing
    as tendonitis.   The word now though\nis that he'll be able to play through it.\n\nChicago's
    James Allen / Anthony Thomas vs Cincinnati Defense\n\nAnother week where it'll
    be tough to tell who gets the carries.   We keep\nexpecting Thomas to grab more
    and more time but Allen is hanging on.   Last\nweek Allen rushed 18 times for
    75 yards (4.2 ypc) plus a TD.   Thomas had 11\ncarries for 58 yards (5.3 ypc)
    \  Obviously, both were effective.   Allen is\nstill getting the Red Zone Touches
    though so it seems pretty clear that\ncoach Dick Jauron has faith in him.   The
    Bengals rank # 23 in Rushing Yards\nAllowed per Game over the last four weeks
    and # 14 in Fantasy Points Allowed\nto RBs.   I'd look for a similar distribution
    of carries between Allen and\nThomas this week although I think you'll see more
    and more of Thomas.   It's\nmurky enough right now, that I don't honestly feel
    real good about either\nguy.\n\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\n\nDownside
    Matchups:  These games feature a Defense that could pose trouble\nfor the Offense.\n\n\nTampa
    Bay's Warrick Dunn / Mike Alstott vs Pittsburgh Defense\n\nWarrick Dunn made it
    back onto the field last week when he wasn't expected\nto.   He did score a TD,
    but overall, he was totally ineffective rushing for\n16 yards on 10 carries (1.6
    ypc)   Mike Alstott was even worse running for 4\nyards on 5 carries (0.8 ypc)
    \  It's pretty bad when Brad Johnson has the\nbest ypc average on the team...at
    2.0 ypc.   This week, they face a tougher\ndefense in Pittsburgh.   The Steelers
    rank # 8 in Rushing Yards Allowed per\nGame over the last four weeks.   They rank
    # 10 in Fantasy Points Allowed to\nRBs.\n\n\nPittsburgh's Jerome Bettis vs Tampa
    Bay Defense\n\nHere's a troubling thought about Jerome Bettis for this week that
    was\nbrought up on our message boards www.footballguystalk.com this week.\nRemember
    in week 1 when all the talk was about Bettis being limited in\nJacksonville because
    of his asthma and the Florida heat and humidity?\nBettis went on to total 28 yards
    on 12 carries (2.3 ypc) against\nJacksonville.  Guess what the weather is predicted
    to be in Tampa?\nhttp://www.footballguys.com/weatherweek6a.htm   84 degrees and
    humid.   It\nwon't help that Tampa has a solid rush defense ranking # 12 in Rushing
    Yards\nAllowed per Game over the last four weeks.   They're stingier with points\nranking
    # 7 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.   On the upside, Linebackers\nDerrick Brooks
    and Jeff Gooch are probably not 100%.   I like Bettis and\nhe's on a roll but
    this is a tough matchup here.\n\n\nNew York Jet's Curtis Martin vs St. Louis Defense\n\nCurtis
    Martin ran exceptionally well against a tough Miami Defense last week\nposting
    120 yards on 22 carries (5.5 ypc)   He's by far the focus of that\noffense.   Look
    for more of the same this week against the Rams.   St. Louis\nis solid against
    the run ranking # 9 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over\nthe last four weeks.
    \ They seem to give up a lot of points though as they\nrank # 17 in Fantasy Points
    Allowed to RBs.   Look for more Martin to again\ncarry the load.\n\n\nAtlanta's
    Maurice Smith vs New Orleans Defense\n\nSmith struggled last week against a good
    San Francisco rush defense.   He\nonly gained 50 yards on 20 carries (2.5 ypc)
    \  Even worse, 24 of those yards\ncame on one carry.   That means he had just
    26 yards on 19 carries for 1.4\nypc.  (Joes Note:  I'm not a fan of taking one
    big play away and looking at\nthe numbers as I think you can really skew the data
    that way.   But, it's\nalso something worth keeping in the back of your mind.)
    \  On the plus side,\nhe garnered 20 of the Falcons 24 rushing attempts so he
    looks to be the man.\nFor an even bigger plus, he scored a rushing TD.   This
    week, he faces a\nvery tough New Orleans defense that ranks # 3 in Rushing Yards
    Allowed per\nGame over the last four weeks.   They rank # 8 in Fantasy Points
    Allowed to\nRBs for the season.   This may not be the best week to start Smith
    if you've\ngot other options.   I want to see how he does against this tough defense\nand
    to see if Coach Dan Reeves starts using Bob Christian a little more.\n\n\nCincinnati's
    Corey Dillon vs Chicago Defense\n\nPower vs Power.   The Bears have been playing
    excellent run defense behind\nBrian Urlacher, Keith Traylor and Ted Washington.
    \  They rank # 10 in\nRushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks.
    \  More\nimpressively, they rank # 5 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs for the
    year.\nDillon will be a great test though as they've not faced a RB of his caliber\nyet.
    \  Last week he rolled for 140 yards on 31 carries (4.5 ypc) and a TD.\nBut the
    Browns don't bring the same defense that Chicago will.   The key\nwill be Jon
    Kitna and his passing game keeping the defense honest.   If the\nsafeties are
    able to walk towards the line, it might be a long day for\nDillon.   He's been
    handled by tough defenses once this year with Baltimore\nholding him to 57 yards
    on 18 carries (3.2 ypc)   It should be noted though\nthat the Bears are not yet
    the Ravens on defense and that Dillon did find\nthe endzone in the Baltimore game
    with a TD reception.   Not the best\nmatchup for Dillon but one that will be fun
    to watch.\n\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\n\nDefensive
    Slam Dunks:  These games feature a very tough Defense posing major\nproblems for
    the Offense.\n\n\nPhiladelphia's Correll Buckhalter / Duce Staley vs New York
    Giants Defense\n\nDuce Staley will likely make his return back from a shoulder
    injury this\nweek but it's unclear how much he'll play.   Rookie Correll Buckhalter's\ndone
    a very good job in his absence.   But I think it's pretty clear that\nit's Duce's
    job when he's healthy.   I'm not too excited about either player\nthis week against
    a Giant defense that is shutting down the running game.\nThey rank # 2 in Rushing
    Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks.\nThey rank # 3 in Fantasy Points
    Allowed to RBs.   I'd avoid both of these\nguys this week unless you're really
    short on options.\n\n\nMinnesota's Doug Chapman / Travis Prentice vs Green Bay
    Defense\n\nFrustrated Michael Bennett owners can at least know for sure how he'll
    do\nthis week.   He won't play.   Bennett's nursing a bad ankle and Coach Denny\nGreen's
    named Doug Chapman the starter.   But also look for Travis Prentice\nto see time
    as the short yardage / goal line guy.   Considering the Vikings\nalready have
    one of the best goal line \"backs\" in the league with QB Daunte\nCulpepper, the
    situation is even murkier.   Throw in the fact that Green Bay\nplays very solid
    rush defense and I'm not real excited about any of the\nViking RBs.   The Packers
    rank # 7 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over\nthe last four weeks.   And they
    rank # 4 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.\n\n\nDenver's Mike Anderson vs San
    Diego Defense\n\nAnderson will have his work cut out for him against a tough Charger
    defense\nthat held New England's Antowain Smith to 36 yards on 15 carries (2.4
    ypc)\nlast week.   Anderson and the Broncos are a lot better than Smith and the\nPatriots
    but still, it won't be easy.   San Diego ranks # 4 in Rushing Yards\nAllowed per
    Game over the last four weeks and # 2 in Fantasy Points Allowed\nto RBs.   Anderson
    was held in check last week against a good Seattle\ndefense rushing for only 51
    yards on 17 carries (3.0 ypc)   QB Brian\nGriese's shoulder is still sore and
    Anderson will need a healthy Griese to\nloosen Safety Rodney Harrison who's a
    run stopper supreme.   Terrell Davis\nhas been making a little noise about possibly
    playing this week but I don't\nsee it.  It's about to get murky again though.
    \  If you don't feel like\ndealing with the Shanahan guessing games here soon,
    you should move Anderson\nnow.\n\n\nCleveland's James Jackson / Jamel White vs
    Baltimore Defense\n\nDon't go here.   Let's say it this way:   Last week, James
    Jackson totaled\n22 yards on 14 carries for a whopping 1.6 ypc number.   Against
    Cincinnati.\nI like the Bengals but they're not Baltimore.   Look elsewhere.\nBaltimore's
    streak of not allowing a 100 yard rusher will end sometime.   It\nwon't be this
    week though.\n\n\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\n\nThat'll

  subject: ! '[Footballguys] BREAKING NEWS - Wheatley to Miss "About a Month"'
  body: ! "Wheatley to Miss \"About a Month\"\n\nEntire story:   http://espn.go.com/nfl/columns/pasquarelli_len/1265229.html\n\nClipped
    from the Len Pasquarelli article from 10-17:\n\nIt looks like Oakland Raiders
    coach Jon Gruden won't have the luxury of\nplaying running back roulette, often
    rotating between Tyrone Wheatley and\nCharlie Garner depending on the game situation
    and formation, for about the\nnext month.\n\nSources told ESPN.com that Wheatley
    likely will miss three to four weeks\nwith a right knee sprain suffered in Sunday
    night's road victory at\nIndianapolis. An examination indicated there is no significant
    structural\ndamage, but Wheatley will need rest and rehabilitation. Oakland has
    a bye\nthis week and resumes play Oct. 28 at Philadelphia.\n\nWheatley apparently
    injured the knee on his third carry of the game, but\nkept playing. Two fourth-quarter
    errors, a fumble that led to a Colts\ntouchdown and a dropped pass that forced
    the Raiders to punt, drew the ire\nof Gruden. The two had words on the sideline,
    Wheatley threw his helmet to\nthe bench and did not return.\n\nThe seventh-year
    veteran is said to be frustrated not only by the injury,\nbut also by what he
    feels is diminished playing time, and the perception\nGruden regards Garner as
    a better fit for the Oakland offense.\n\nWheatley started the Sunday night game,
    but Garner opened the previous two\ncontests, and the players started the first
    two games of the year in tandem.\nAlthough Wheatley has more rushes than Garner
    (55-53), the latter has more\n\"touches\" (72-63), because of his abilities as
    a receiver.\n\nThe Raiders have used Garner at tailback, slot receiver and wide
    receiver,\nand it appears his versatility is well-suited to an offense that utilizes
    a\ndizzying assortment of formations and shifts.\n\nThe absence of Wheatley could
    further stymie a running game that has lacked\nthe power of a year ago. The Raiders
    are statistically ranked 19th in\nrushing after leading the league in 2000. Oakland
    is averaging just 98.2\nrushing yards per game and 3.4 yards per carry. In the
    first five games last\nyear, the Raiders averaged 123.8 yards per game and 4.1
    yards per attempt.\n\nGruden has worked No. 3 tailback Randy Jordan into the lineup
    in certain\nsituations and said earlier this week he wants to get the versatile
    Terry\nKirby involved as well. Kirby does not have a rushing attempt this season.\n\n\n[
    [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [  OUR VIEW  ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ]\n\n\nClearly,
    huge news for Garner.   We've been hyping him as the guy who'll see\nmore and
    more carries and I think that would have happened even without the\nWheatley injury.
    \  Garner will obviously benefit from the increased playing\ntime.   Wheatley
    owners go to the backup plan and you other folks may\nconsider making a move for
    Garner.\n\nMore as we hear it.\n\nJoe\n\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\n\nBryant

  subject: ! '[Footballguys] Update # 125 10-16 Week 6 Upgrade - Downgrades'
  body: ! "Hi Folks,\n\nFootballguy Scott Luebke takes a look at this week's players
    who are moving\nup and down in value.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTE:  Remember that Dallas,
    and Oakland are on byes this week in\naddition to Miami, Seattle and San Francisco.
    \  Dallas and Oakland were\noriginally scheduled to play but moved their game
    up.   This could affect\nyour team if you had planned on any Cowboys or Raiders
    filling in for your\nMiami, Seattle and San Francisco players.   Don't get caught
    shorthanded and\nmake a pickup if you need to.\n\nAlso remember the Thursday game
    this week if your league has special rules\nfor turning in rosters.\n\nHave a
    great week.\n\nJoe\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\n\nUpgrades\n\nQBs
    Moving Up\n\nQB - Jeff Garcia - Garcia looked great on Sunday against the Falcons
    with\n332 passing yards, 70 rushing yards and 4 total touchdowns.  He continues
    to\nprove that the 2000 season is no aberration.  As long as Terrell Owens\nremains
    healthy, Garcia will continue to produce.  Very impressive on\nSunday.\n\nQB -
    Steve McNair - After appearing invisible for the season heading into\nSunday,
    McNair shocked and impressed fantasy owners with 230 yards passing,\n54 yards
    rushing and 2 total touchdowns against a solid Tampa Bay defense.\nAlthough he
    was impressive on Sunday, don't rely on McNair as your fantasy\nteam starter on
    a weekly basis.  If McNair could get some big play weapons\non offense, he could
    become a top flight fantasy quarterback.  For now, be\nhappy with Sunday's performance.\n\nQB
    - Vinny Testaverde - Testaverde impressed with an efficient performance\nonce
    again on Sunday.  Testaverde has yet to throw an interception this\nseason.  With
    4 touchdowns in the last 2 games, Vinny is looking good.  Keep\nin mind, Testaverde
    has yet to surpass the 200 yard barrier, so his value is\nmuch higher in basic
    scoring leagues.\n\n\nRBs Moving Up\n\nRB - Ricky Williams - After a slow start
    to the season, Williams has gained\n356 total yards and 2 touchdowns in his last
    2 games.  Keep in mind,\nWilliams has already had his bye, so he should be a fixture
    in your lineup\nfor the remainder of the season as long as he stays healthy.\n\nRB
    - Eddie George - George finally delighted fantasy owners with 132 total\nyards
    and a touchdown on Sunday.  The patient owner will start to see the\nrewards of
    having George on the roster for the remainder of the season.\nWith George having
    Miami, Jacksonville, Baltimore, Tampa Bay and a bye week\nin the first 5 weeks
    of the season, his schedule was difficult.  The\nschedule only gets easier for
    George during the remainder of the season.\nLook for a strong finish to the season
    out of George.\n\nRB - Priest Holmes - With Tony Richardson out of the lineup,
    Holmes was\ngiven the chance to produce and he has not disappointed.  During his
    last 3\ngames, Holmes has averaged 158 total yards and scored 5 touchdowns.  More\nimportantly,
    Holmes has apparently claimed the feature back role in the\nKansas City offense.
    \ Look for Holmes to ride the \"production train\" for the\nnext few weeks with
    matchups against Arizona and Indianapolis.\n\nRB - Warrick Dunn - Expected to
    be out 4-6 weeks, Dunn returned to the\nlineup after a 1 week absence and delighted
    fantasy owners.  Despite having\njust 16 yards rushing, Dunn added 65 yards receiving
    and 2 touchdowns.  The\nearly return gives Dunn a tremendous upgrade.\n\nRB -
    Shaun Alexander - Will Ricky Watters have the starting job when he\nreturns from
    injury?  Probably not.  Alexander finished with 142 rushing\nyards and 2 touchdowns
    against Denver.  With Watters in the last year of his\ncontract, look for the
    Seahawks to keep Alexander in the starting lineup for\nthe remainder of the season.
    \ A great keeper/dynasty running back.\n\nRB - Ron Dayne - After being limited
    in practice by a neck injury suffered\nin the Washington game, Dayne hit the field
    and a delighted fantasy owners.\nWith 88 rushing yards and a touchdown on Sunday,
    Dayne continues to gain\nmomentum into being named the team's feature back.  With
    Tiki Barber\nhampered by a hamstring injury, Dayne will be able to post quality
    numbers\nagainst some poor defenses.\n\n\nWRs Moving Up\n\nWR - Keyshawn Johnson
    - Johnson took over the game with 8 catches for 140\nyards against Tennessee.
    \ However, he has yet to connect with Brad Johnson\nfor a receiving touchdown
    this season.\n\nWR - Kevin Johnson - Johnson was able to beat a bad Cincinnati
    secondary for\na career high 153 yards receiving on Sunday.  With the continued
    development\nof Tim Couch, Johnson could be a quality fantasy option for the remainder
    of\nthe season.  Keep in mind, Cleveland plays in a tough division where low\nscoring
    games will be the norm.\n\nWR - Terry Glenn - Once thought to be written off for
    the entire season,\nGlenn returned in a big way on Sunday with 110 yards and a
    touchdown.  If\nthe Patriots offensive line can protect the quarterback, Glenn
    could have a\ndecent remainder of the season.  Don't expect these type of numbers
    every\nweek.  Look for Glenn to put up inconsistent numbers the rest of the way.\n\nWR
    - Terrell Owens - 183 receiving yards and 3 touchdowns deserves an\nupgrade in
    my book.  Basically, keep him in your lineup every week.\n\nWR - Germane Crowell
    - Crowell finished with 125 yards and a touchdown on\nSunday.  Everything looked
    good with Charlie Batch at the helm for the\npassing game.  Reality check...this
    game was against the hapless Vikings\nsecondary.  Regardless, 125 yards and a
    touchdown deserves the upgrade.\n\n\n\nTEs Moving Up\n\nTE - Cam Cleeland - Despite
    having just 3 catches for 38 yards on Sunday,\nCleeland was able to get into the
    scoring column with the all important 2\ntouchdowns.  With opponents fearful of
    the Saints wide receiving corps of\nHorn, Jackson and Crowell, Cleeland is seeing
    plenty of one on one coverage.\nCleeland is most likely on a fantasy roster.  If
    not, go get him.\n\nTE - Bubba Franks - 2 reception for 4 yards.  Not that impressive,
    unless\nyou realize that both catches were touchdowns. Franks has scored 5\ntouchdowns
    in the first 5 games this season.  Look for continued success as\nFranks is a
    key to success for the Packers in the red zone.\n\nTE - Marcus Pollard - The Colts
    continue to get Pollard involved in the\noffense.  He has averaged 58 receiving
    yards in the last 2 games while\nscoring a touchdown.  However, Pollard ran a
    couple poor routes that led to\ntwo interceptions for Manning.\n\n\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\n\nDowngrades\n\n\nQBs
    Moving Down\n\nQB - Rob \"The Running Joke\" Johnson - Yep, that's right.  With
    the help of\nall the sharks out there, we were able to once again downgrade Rob
    Johnson,\neven with him being on a bye week.  After spending a few hours laughing\nthrough
    numerous Rob Johnson takes, I was unable to come to a decision on\nthe best take.
    \ With that said, I will let you, the sharks, decide the best\nRob Johnson downgrade
    take.  Cast your vote on the footballguystalk.com\nmessage board.   Buffalo Fans,
    we feel your pain out there.   I know you\nguys are some of the best fans in the
    league, we're just trying to lighten\nthings up.   Here are a few takes from some
    of our readers:\n\nTake #1: I just took the SAT, and actually had this question.
    I think it\nsums it up best.\n\nSamuel L. Jackson is to Mr. Glass as Rob Johnson
    is to _______.\nA) Mr. Styrofoam\nB) Mr. Balsa Wood\nC) Mr. Tin Foil\nD) Mrs.
    Glass\n\nI said D. What do you think, did I get it right?\n\nThanks\nJonathon
    Hoff\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n----\n\nTake
    #2: Rob Johnson took his heaviest blow this past week, injuring not\nonly his
    neck (pinched nerve), but also his \"best side\". Johnson was quoted\nas saying
    \"Sure, the neck hurts, but this bruise on my cheek is really going\nto affect
    my promo photos. How's a guy supposed to make a living?\" While\nJohnson is day-to-day
    because of the neck, it appears his profile injury\nwill keep him out of the \"pretty
    business\" for 3-4 weeks. Adding insult to\ninjury, his agent apparently will
    have Flutie sub for Johnson during this\nhiatus. The agent responded \"Hey, when
    Johnson couldn't cut it on the\nfootball field last year, Flutie kicked ass, so
    I suspect he can replace Rob\nhere, too.\" We're downgrading the Buffalo QB, and
    we'd keep Johnson on the\nbench in fantasy football, and in fantasy modeling.\n\nGuy
    Whitehead\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n----\n\nTake
    #3: Top 5 Reasons to downgrade Rob Johnson:\n\n5. Silly headband brings back painful
    80s memories\n\n4. Deceased blues legend Robert Johnson is a more viable fantasy
    option\n\n3. Janet Reno considers ordering agents to take Doug Flutie by force
    and\nreturn him to his rightful home in Buffalo. Johnson might be sent to Cuba
    to\nlive with Elian Gonzalez. Castro to protest before United Nations and demand\nAlex
    Van Pelt instead.\n\n2. Sneaky agent includes bonus clause for appearing on injury
    report.\n\n1. Jerry Jones praises Johnson as his \"next big find\".\n\nRegards,\nMKF\n\n\nSeriously
    Now, Another QB Moving Down\n\nQB - Trent Green - Green continues to disappoint
    fantasy owners.  With the\nnagging injuries to Derrick Alexander and Marvin Minnis
    being inexperienced,\nGreen continues to have problems finding his wide receivers.
    \ Prior to the\nseason, there was speculation that the loss of Sylvester Morris
    would hurt\nGreen's production.  The speculation was correct.\n\n\nRBs Moving
    Down\n\nRB - Ricky Watters - The emergence of Shaun Alexander downgrades the injured\nWatters'
    value further.\n\nRB - Marshall Faulk -   Faulk suffered a sprained MCL on Sunday.
    \ Initial\nindications speculated that Faulk would miss 4 weeks of action.  The
    next\nreports had Faulk missing 1-2 games.   Now they're saying he could play
    this\nweek!   Regardless, make sure you grab Trung Canidate, if you are a Faulk\nowner.
    \  It'll help you sleep better.\n\nRB - Tyrone Wheatley - Despite getting the
    carry at the goal line and a\nshort score, Wheatley gets the downgrade this week.
    \ With just 7 carries for\n24 yards and a fumble, it appears the Raiders are leaning
    towards making\nCharlie Garner the feature back.  More importantly, Wheatley missed
    a key\npass block that led to a hard hit on Rich Gannon.  Basically, it appeared\nthat
    Wheatley shied away from contact on the play and did his best\nbullfighter imitation.
    \ Jon Gruden did not appear very happy.\n\nRB - Mike Alstott - 5 carries for 4
    yards...OUCH!\n\nRB - Michael Bennett - Bennett was able to manage 13 carries
    on Sunday.\nHowever, he finished with just 46 rushing yards and no touchdowns.
    \ Plus,\nBennett suffered a sprained right ankle that forced him out of the game.\nKeep
    him on your bench for the time being.\n\n\nWRs Moving Down\n\nWR - Bill Schroeder
    - Schroeder suffered a sprained ankle in Sunday's game\nversus Baltimore.  The
    injury does not appear to be serious, but something\nworth watching.  Because
    of the injury, Schroeder is downgraded this week.\n\nWR - Derrick Alexander -
    Plain and simple, Alexander has done nothing this\nseason and is among the biggest
    disappointments of the fantasy season.\nAlexander earns a spot on the \"Biggest
    Disappointment Team\".\n\nWR - Willie Jackson - Although I am still high on Willie
    Jackson, he was\nheld to just 25 yards on 2 catches this weekend.  Every receiver
    will have\nbad outings throughout the course of the year so this might be a little\nharsh
    placing him here.   But it's a murky situation how the distribution\nwill play
    out in New Orleans.   QB Aaron Brooks needs to get it going.\n\nWR - Wayne Chrebet
    - Chrebet has failed to score on the year and seems to\nhave taken a back seat
    to Laveranues Coles in the Jets wide receiving crew.\nThere's a chance Chrebet's
    numbers could increase as team's start focusing\ntheir attention on the speedy
    Coles but for now, we're a little worried\nabout Chrebet.\n\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\n\nWaiver
    Wire\n\n\nQB - Charlie Batch - During comeback mode against the Vikings, Batch
    managed\nto gain 345 yards and pass for 3 touchdowns.  Don't get too high on Batch\nyet.
    \ Remember, this performance came against a mediocre Vikings secondary.\nHowever,
    Johnnie Morton and Germane Crowell provide Batch with two quality\nreceivers.
    \ Look for more good games out of Batch...against weaker defenses.\n\nQB - Tom
    Brady - With the addition of Terry Glenn in the lineup, Brady\ntorched the San
    Diego defense throughout the game.  Don't expect these kind\nof numbers on a weekly
    basis, but there are signs that Brady has the\npotential to become a good fantasy
    quarterback, although you have to\nconsider Bledsoe and what happens when he's
    ready to go.   Regardless, Brady\nis a decent option for fantasy owners in need
    of a quarterback right now.\n\nRB - Trung Canidate - Canidate will probably get
    at least start as the\nrunning back for the powerful Rams offense.  Marshall Faulk
    was expected to\nmiss at least 4 weeks during initial reports.  The the next reports
    have\nFaulk missing 1-2 weeks of action.   Now they're saying he could play this\nweek.
    \  He's still not a bad guy to have for insurance.\n\nRB - Anthony Thomas - Thomas
    continues to get a good number of carries.  It\nis becoming more apparent that
    the Bears are slowly giving the feature back\nrole to Thomas.  Look for Thomas'
    role to become larger and larger as the\nseason progresses.\n\nWR - Terry Glenn
    - Once thought to be written off for the entire season,\nGlenn returned in a big
    way on Sunday with 110 yards and a touchdown.  If\nthe Patriots offensive line
    can protect the quarterback, Glenn could have a\ndecent remainder of the season.
    \ Don't expect these type of numbers every\nweek, but Glenn could be a welcome
    addition to a fantasy team in need of a\nreceiver.\n\nWR - Donald Hayes - With
    defenses rolling coverage in the direction of the\ntalented Muhsin Muhammad, Donald
    Hayes is seeing a lot of one-on-one\ncoverage.  With 7 catches and a touchdown
    on Sunday, it appears that Chris\nWeinke and Hayes are starting to build a quality
    QB to WR relationship.\n\nWR - Eddie Kennison - Kennison showed signs of quality
    production this week.\nWith Rod Smith seeing double/triple coverage on the other
    side of the field,\nKennison will be given a great chance to post excellent fantasy
    numbers.\nKennison is an extremely talented receiver and maybe this week's performance\nwas
    needed to get him \"over the hump\".\n\nCheck back next week for The General's
    All-Disappointment Team.\n\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\n\nBryant

  subject: ! '[Footballguys] Update # 123 Quick Hitters - Griese & Alexander'
  body: ! "Hi Folks,\n\nLots of email pouring in on these guys so I wanted to share
    the latest here:\n\n\nGriese \"Questionable\" But Should Start\n\nEntire Story:
    \  http://espn.go.com/nfl/news/2001/1012/1263238.html\n\nDENVER -- After missing
    most of Thursday's practice with a sore throwing\nshoulder, Denver Broncos quarterback
    Brian Griese was a full participant in\nFriday's workout and was expected to start
    on Sunday in Seattle.\n\nThe Broncos added Griese to their injury report on Friday
    morning, listing\nhim as questionable.\n\nAn hour later, however, Griese had no
    obvious discomfort during a 75-minute\nworkout. Coach Mike Shanahan said he was
    confident that, barring any\nsetbacks, Griese will play against the Seahawks.\n\nGriese
    has had surgery twice on his shoulder, after the 1999 and 2000\nseasons.\n\nShanahan
    said Griese reported soreness in his shoulder after Sunday's 20-6\nwin over Kansas
    City. The injury likely occurred in the first half, since\nGriese threw only five
    passes after intermission. For the game, he was\n11-of-20 for 121 yards with one
    touchdown and one interception.\n\n\"It was sore after the game, but we didn't
    think it was anything that would\nkeep him from playing,\" Shanahan said Friday.
    \"He couldn't practice\n(Thursday). He just took a few reps and it was sore. That's
    why we put him\non the questionable list. I wasn't really sure where we'd be at
    (Friday).\n\n\"But he was able to make it through practice and he was effective.
    So if\nthere's no setback, then he'll be able to go Sunday.\"\n\nIf Griese had
    been unable to practice Friday, Shanahan said, the Broncos\nwould have prepared
    backup Gus Frerotte for a starting role.\n\n\"If you don't practice Thursday and
    Friday, then you don't start,\" Shanahan\nsaid. \"But he was able to go through
    the whole practice, and he practiced\nwell.\"\n\n\n[ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [  OUR
    VIEW  ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ]\n\n\nScary news to see him listed but sounds
    like good news that he'll play.\nGotta love Shanahan making a mockery of the \"Questionable\"
    listing saying\nhe's confident Griese will play.   As we've been telling you since
    May, you\nshould back up your valuable skill guys in great situations with their
    real\nbackup.   It was a lot better before Ed McCaffrey's injury but Griese would\nprobably
    qualify as one of those guys in great situations.   If you (or your\narch rival)
    own Griese, it's a good idea that you grab Frerotte if you\nhaven't already.\n\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\n\nDerrick
    Alexander Improving\n\nFrom an interview with Dick Vermeil today on KCChiefs.com\n\nQuestion:
    Did (WR) Derrick Alexander take a full day of reps?\n\nVERMEIL: \"Not the full
    amount but he did work. I asked him after practice\nhow he felt and he said he
    felt good. I don't know how long it's been since\nhe's said he felt good.\"\n\nESPN.com
    is also reporting on their Injuries page that Alexander will be\nable to play
    this week. (although I take that page with a grain of salt)\n\n[ [ [ [ [ [ [ [
    [ [ [ [ [  OUR VIEW  ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ]\n\n\nIt's a risky play here.
    \  We'd told you this week that it wasn't looking\ngood for Alexander's back.
    \  He seems to be over the Achilles trouble but\nthe back was so stiff earlier
    this week he couldn't tie his shoes.   That\nappears to be getting better.   Still
    though, he's a large risk.   I would\nstill shy away unless I didn't have any
    alternatives close to him.   A sore\nback is the kind of thing that could tighten
    up at any time and it's just\ntoo risky in my opinion.\n\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\n\nMore

  subject: ! '[Footballguys] Late News Report - Faulk to Sit Sunday'
  body: ! "Hi Folks,\n\nSt. Louis News and Notes from our Buddy and Footballguy Bob
    Harris of the\naward winning www.TFLReport.com\n\nFAULK WON'T PLAY AGAINST JETS
    TOMORROW...\n\nPosted Saturday October 20, 2001 @ 17:35 PT\n\n\nIn a message posted
    on his online forum at the St. Louis Post-Dispatch web\nsite, columnist Bernie
    Miklasz stated that Rams running back Marshall Faulk\nwon't play against the New
    York Jets tomorrow, a development head coach Mike\nMartz all but announced Friday
    evening when told reporters he was\n\"pessimistic\" about Faulk's chances of hitting
    the field this weekend.\n\nFaulk, who refused to talk to the media Friday, was
    listed as questionable\non the official midweek injury report after bruising his
    right knee last\nweekend against the Giants. He sat out of practice all week but
    worked out\non a treadmill. He appeared to be pain free, walking without a limp.
    On\nFriday, the knee was not wrapped.\n\nBut Martz said at the time, \"The thing
    with a bone bruise is (if) you play,\nit sets you back. It's a temptation that's
    hard to fight because he wants to\nplay. In his mind he should play, but we're
    trying to do the right thing\nwith this and make sure that we've got him for the
    rest of the season.\"\n\nThe coach went on to say he was confident in Trung Canidate's
    ability to get\nthe job done in Faulk's absence.\n\nQuarterback Kurt Warner, who
    has never played in a game for the Rams without\nFaulk lined up behind him, agreed
    with that assessment.\n\n\"Trung has played well when he has played. He has never
    been in a position\nwhere he has to carry the load. Now it is all on him. Trung
    is going to be\nfine. He knows the system and he is a good football player. Now
    he's going\nto get a chance to shine a little bit. We all have confidence in him
    that he\nis going to do a great job.\"\n\nWarner also pointed out that the already
    blazing fast St. Louis offense\nbecomes even faster with Canidate in the mix.\n\n\"Trung
    is so explosive with his speed that if you give that guy a crack he\ncan take
    it against anybody,\" the former Arena League star explained. \"We\nhave seen
    him cut back and make some huge plays already this year. Trung has\nan extra gear
    and he brings that speed to the equation. We are going to have\nto get him up
    to speed with the route running part of it, and those are the\nkinds of things
    that he will have to iron out to get to the same level so\nthat we can do everything
    that we do with Marshall with him.\"\n\nWhile Canidate is clearly expected to
    handle the bulk of the workload,\nRobert Holcombe is likely to get a carry or
    two also. ...\n\nOther notes of interest. ...\n\nAccording to SportsLine.com senior
    writer Pete Prisco, when you ask most NFL\nplayers to assess their backup, you
    generally get a positive response --\noften in the form of an eloquent or enthusiastic
    vote of confidence that\ncasts the backup in question in the best possible light.\n\nHowever,
    that wasn't the case when Faulk was asked about Canidate last\nSunday.\n\nPrisco
    wrote at the time, \"Faulk clearly did not want to discuss his\nreplacement. In
    fairness, it was only an hour or so after he injured his\nknee against the Giants,
    but even so, what would it have hurt to prop the\nkid up?\"\n\nAsked what fans
    could expect from Canidate, the former Colts said, \"I don't\nknow. You'll have
    to ask Mike Martz. He hasn't played. I don't know. I\nhaven't watched him play.
    I saw him play in the preseason.''\n\nAsked if he'd be willing to guess what the
    former University of Arizona star\nmight be capable of, Faulk shot back with \"Your
    guess is as good as mine.''\n\nFaulk's behavior prompted Prisco to openly wonder
    whether the best running\nback in the league felt threatened by Canidate's youthful
    speed or whether\nhe simply doesn't like the kid. .. Whatever his reason was,
    Faulk clearly\nhad no interest in propping up the guy in the locker next to his.\n\nAnd
    finally. ...\n\nWarner, who was knocked out of the game for a play by Giants defensive
    end\nMichael Strahan, said he was fine on Thursday.\n\n\"To tell you the truth
    I feel great,\" the veteran signal caller said. \"Other\nthan where I got hit
    when I got the wind knocked out of me. My back is a\nlittle bit sore and my ribs.
    Other than that I feel great. I was a little\nsore on Monday but I feel good today.\"\n----------\n(c)

  subject: ! '[Footballguys] BREAKING BAD NEWS ALLEGATIONS - Travis Henry'
  body: ! "\nTravis Henry to Face Possible Sex Charges\n\n\nEntire story:   http://www.buffalonews.com/editorial/20011019/1047714.asp\n\nClipped
    from the Bucky Gleason article:\n\nBuffalo Bills running back Travis Henry faces
    criminal charges that are\nexpected to be lodged next week in connection with
    a sex-related incident\ninvolving a 15-year-old girl in his home, law enforcement
    officials said.\n\nThe officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Thursday
    that Henry\nlikely would be offered a plea arrangement that would allow him to
    avoid a\nstatutory rape charge in exchange for a guilty plea to a\nyet-to-be-determined
    misdemeanor charge.\n\nCharges could be filed as early as Monday or Tuesday, officials
    said.\n\n\"I've just become involved,\" said Henry's attorney, Terrence M. Connors.\n\"I'm
    talking to Travis and trying to find out the underlying facts and\nexploring all
    the options.\"\n\nInvestigators have been looking into the incident since Sept.
    23, when two\ngirls escaped from Hopevale Union Free School, a detention home
    for girls in\nHamburg.\n\nInvestigators said Henry, 22, had returned with the
    Bills from their game in\nIndianapolis and met the girls, 15 and 14, during a
    chance encounter at a\nCamp Road gas station.\n\nThe three went to watch television
    at Henry's house, where the sexual\nencounter is alleged to have taken place with
    one of the girls, who\napparently told Henry she was 18.\n\nSources said Henry
    acknowledged having sex with the girl but said he didn't\nknow she was a juvenile.\n\nHenry
    had not been charged as of Thursday. The rookie was in Jacksonville\nfor the Bills'
    game against the Jaguars.\n\nHamburg Police Chief Joseph Coggins would say only
    that the case was under\ninvestigation. Erie County District Attorney Frank J.
    Clark would not\ncomment on the case.\n\nA person who is older than 21 can be
    charged with statutory rape for having\nsexual intercourse with someone younger
    than 17, regardless of consent.\nHowever, authorities generally treat cases differently
    when one person is in\nthe early 20s and the other is in the midteens.\n\nSources
    said prosecutors might be willing to give Henry leniency because the\ngirl admitted
    lying about her age and said she was not forced into having\nsex, and because
    Henry has no prior criminal record.\n\nThe Bills have been aware of the inquiry
    for more than a week. President and\nGeneral Manager Tom Donahoe would not comment
    on the case.\n\n\"Until there's something that officially comes out, I can't respond,\"\nDonahoe
    said from Jacksonville.\n\n\n[ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [  OUR VIEW  ] ] ] ] ] ]
    ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ]\n\n\nLet's see how this plays out.   As the article says,
    it's likely this would\nhave the end result of a misdemeanor charge.   Still troubling
    though.\nMore as we hear it.\n\nJoe\n\n/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/\n\nBryant

    performance (I'm\none of you) last week need to keep an eye on this.\n\nFoxboro,
    MA (Sports Network) - Patriots wide receiver Terry Glenn injured\nhis hamstring
    during a workout on Thursday, and may not suit up for Sunday's\ngame against the
    Colts.\n\nMidway through the Patriots' afternoon session, Glenn came up hobbling
    after\nmaking a cut on a pass route. The extent of his injury is not known.\n\nGlenn
    also experienced soreness after the team's 29-26 overtime win over the\nChargers
    last week. Yet, he may have aggravated the injury on Thursday,\npossibly resulting
    in a pull or tear.\n\nThe six-year Ohio State product caught seven passes for

    Busby/NA/Enron@Enron (bcc: Ruth \nConcannon/HOU/ECT)\nSubject: Procedures for
    Incremental Empire Gas for On-Peak Day Ahead Market\n\nMarty suggested that I
    get these discussions kicked off on your side while he \nwas\nout-of-town today.
    \ Basically, I started off with your proposed procedures \nand made\na few changes
    that Enron needs to make sure that right amount of gas shows up \nat the\ncorrect
    time.\n\nAlso, we are suggesting a confirmation form be sent back and forth between
    \nEnron and\nSithe every day.  This will help document all the small little details
    and \ncosts so that we\nboth drop anything through the cracks.  I am suggesting
    that we e-mail this \nconfirm form\nto the right folks in both our companies,
    so that no one is left out of the \nloop.\n\nYou will also notice our attempt
    to make sure that everyone has a clear \nunderstanding\nof exactly what is included
    in the numbers that are reported to Enron's \ntraders.  The timing\nof your calls
    will be when everyone is very busy in our trading group.  There \nwill not be
    much\ntime to have long conversations, but it is very important that everyone
    have \nthe same\nunderstanding what the numbers mean.\n\nPlease take a look at
    this on your side and see if there are some other \nthings that need to\nbe included.\n\nThanks,\n\nRuth\n\n\n"
