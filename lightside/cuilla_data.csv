",Re: new years
1,"Hey pops I guess you know that the NASDAQ is getting crushed - I think you 
should be OK but I think we should look at changing some of your holdings.  I 
looked and some of your funds haven't done so well this year especially Low 
Priced Stock.  Also, I am worried about earnings for many companies with 
energy prices so high and the prospect of very high prices this winter.  I 
don't know but it might be prudent to even move some money into cash or up 
your bond exposure.  I'll try to call you and talk about it later.  If I 
don't talk to you in the next couple of days remind me and maybe we can look 
at some options when you are here for the wedding.",
0,"I thought you would be interested in the weather forecast for the Wedding.  
The data includes max temp, max temp deviation from normal (ie if max is 88 
and normal max is 86 max temp deviation is +2), min temp, min temp deviation 
from normal and percent of precipitation.  So far things are looking good.  
We are getting a cold front this weekend (hitting Texas on Monday) and looks 
like things should be beautiful for next weekend.  I wouldn't be that worried 
about the rain either - the reason the POP is so high right now is tropical 
moisture in the Gulf of Mexico and that will blow through this weekend.  
After that the tropics settle down and it is much less likely to get 
tropical  moisture.

0,"Amy and Alec are definitely welcome!  Actually we had already planned on Amy 
and Alec coming and a couple who we are friends with is bringing their 
daughter, our flower girl, who is about 4 years old.  We have a whole room to 
ourselves at the restaurant so Amy and Alec should be fine.  I talked to 
grandma and she said Julie wouldn't be able to make it so I already knew 
about that.  Don't worry about having 4 more people, the only reason we were 
cautious about inviting aunts and uncles was we didn't want to open up the 
flood gates but most of them already live in Houston or aren't going to make 
it to Houston until late Friday.  As far as the bill just let me know what 
you are comfortable with and we will pick up the rest.  The food bill with 
tax and tip will be about $1,350.  We are very appreciative to have both our 
parent's help as we quickly found that weddings are very expensive.  However, 
we are both adults with good careers and try to be very self-sufficient.  
Also, we realize that some things we do seem extravagant by our parents 
standards.  We could have just as easily had a rehearsal at a Mexican 
restaurant and it would have been cheaper - however we would rather have 
things a certain way and pay for the difference.  Also, I know that you guys 
are on a tight budget with the building of your house.  The bottom line is 
that we are grateful for any help we receive and have the resources to pay 
the balance.  Our most  important concern is that all our family and friends 
to have a great time.  While I am on the subject, I hope your mother and 
grandma Ina aren't going to get their feeling hurt about people drinking wine 
at the dinner.  If you think they will please mention it to them on the way 
down because I don't want them to be offended but I can't change who Zooey 
and I are.  Just so you know we will have dinner and desert and then there 
will be several toasts starting with the best man (James Cook) and the matron 
of honor (Amber) and then probably ending in Zooey and me doing a quick 
toast.  We would love for all our family to be there but if grandmother or 
Betty Joyce is going to get offended and don't want to stay I understand.  
Also, do you know if Skipper is planning to attend.  We haven't received a 
reply card as to whether he will be there or not.  As to this weekend, I am 
going to try to stop by but don't have a car so just depends what is going 
on.  I will be in Dallas so if Mark is coming over Saturday afternoon I could 
get a ride from him.  I'll try to talk to him and see if that works.  
Finally, we are both really looking forward to our big day and are very glad 
to have all our family there to support us!  If you have any questions please 
call me tonight at the house.

     Hi Marty,

     Amy and I were talking over the weekend and she said she did not plan
     to attend the rehearsal dinner because there was no one to keep Alec.
     Would you and Zooey think it was OK if she came and brought Alec for
     dinner only and left as soon as they were through eating?  She said
     she did not want to ask you about it because she didn't want you or
     Zooey to feel any pressure.  This is your special time and she doesn't
     want to detract from it in any way.  I feel sorry for her missing out.
     It is hard for Alec to be still and quite for very long but I think he
     would be fine while we are eating.  Would you please talk with Zooey
     and ask her how she feels about Amy bringing Alec for a while.  Amy
     would leave right away if Alec was disturbing anyone.  If you prefer
     he doesn't come, just say so.  There will certainly be no hard
     feelings over it.

     I spoke with Betty Joyce Sunday and Julianna and her husband are not
     going to be able to come.  Joyce, Chester, Renee, and Travis (her
     boyfriend) are planning to arrive in Houston Friday afternoon the
     29th.  Dad and I are bringing Grandma Ina and Mamanet with us and
     should arrive early in the afternoon on Friday.  Mike decided to fly
     and is coming in Saturday around 4 p.m.  There will be 9 or 11
     (depending if Amy comes) of us from our family for the rehearsal
     dinner.  I know that is more that you had planned on but I will pay
     for the extra people.  Why don't you call me when you have time and we
     can talk about it.

     Now that Mamanet is coming, she is very excited about the trip.  She
     called me yesterday when she got her ticket and she said she had
     really wanted to come but didn't think she would have the chance to
     come.  I'm glad I was able to work it out.

     Grandma Ina will arrive here this week on Thursday.  It seems like I
     remember you and Zooey were going to be in town this weekend for her
     class reunion.  I know you have a busy schedule and may not have time
     to come by, but if you do let me know when and we will plan lunch or
     whatever.  If you have time you can see the new house.  It is looking
     better every day.

     Love,

     Mom

until 1pm to submit your free agent requests to me at mcuilla@enron.com.  You

interested in.  It is the Paris Collection Dining Table and Chairs and the 
numbers are:

346-242  Table
346-244  Base
346-502  Air Chair (4)

Also I am interested in one of the two beds in the Paris Collection:

346-527  Metal Canopy 5-0
346-457  Poster Bed 5-0
346-416  Poster Headboard 4-6 thru 5-0

On the second bed I am not sure if you need all three pieces or not so it 
would help if you could tell me what is the difference between the three 
pieces.  Finally, I am interested in an amroire and chest of draws (there are 
several depending if I go with a granite top or not):
346-144  Armoire
346-237  Right Stone Top

I look forward to hearing from you tomorrow.  If it is easier you can email 
me with the prices and then call to go over the info (instead of having to 
give 15 prices).  My work number is 713-853-5933.

still the best reward that they have (we have another 2,500 points already).  
Also, I straightened up the deal with AT&T Long distance and they are going 
to correct the bill to $33.23 and starting with the next bill we are supposed 
to get 120 minutes a month of free long distance so talk up.  Also, two other 
things - I checked BofA and the Negril pulse came through as $142.09 and also 
I was looking at the AT&T credit card and it had a charge for $117.50 from 
Chi's cakes and more.  I guess that is just the charge for the cake but 
wanted to make sure the it wasn't for the cake stands.  

Since we are both big rich types you want to go to dinner tonight?  Let me
